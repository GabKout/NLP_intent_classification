,text,DA
1,so,F
2,topic of this meeting is i want to talk a little bit about transcription.,S
31,yeah.,B
48,as it is it's sort of a ad hoc combination of stuff dan set and stuff i set up.,S
51,and the other thing is that um university of washington may want to start recording meetings as well.,S
86,i see.,S
140,yeah sort of,D
149,um in addition to this issue about the u.w. stuff there was announced today uh via the l.d.c. um a corpus from i believe santa barbara.,S
160,they had people come in to a certain degree and they and they have dat recorders.,S
180,no.,S
199,just these.,S
214,so we can get that just with uh media costs.,S
226,the other thing too is from from a,D
253,yeah.,B
271,okay.,S
275,right.,S
287,oh.,B
290,but maybe we should find some day that liz uh liz and andreas seem to be around more often.,S
308,so it has a uh nice useful tcl t.k. user interface.,S
341,that's part of the thing we're talking about.,S
358,so then she can decide oh we don't need all this stuff.,S
382,duh again,D
393,there's a reason why he's resisted.,S
395,well if it's zero then we can't do any transcription.,S
430,do so until you actually have a little experience with what this this french thing does we don't even have,D
458,and,F
459,so i mean i've been sort of playing with uh different ways of because i'm thinking you know i mean if you could get optimal instructions you could cut back on the number of hours it would take.,S
495,i mean it depends on the error rate.,S
517,although i was i you know the alternative which i was sort of experimenting with before i ran out of time recently was um that you know if it were like an arbitrary segment of time pre marked.,S
553,i mean it's not bad.,S
572,if we can go from ten x. to five x. we're doing a big,D
590,uh i don't know.,S
604,maybe maybe we could try the following experiment.,S
627,and and throw out the words.,S
691,yep.,S
725,it might save ninety percent of the work though.,S
728,so i i need to we need to look at what what the final output is.,S
734,yeah.,B
755,right.,S
767,which is a service that you send an audio file.,S
813,just seems like,D
884,you know it's a lot like he's worth fifty an hour.,S
908,but at any rate so we we have a ballpark on how much it would cost if we send it out.,S
954,so that means that even if it takes them thirty times real time it's cheaper to to do graduate students.,S
960,because they might get it more right the first time.,S
978,yeah.,B
1017,unfortunately.,S
1110,so,F
1111,but apart from that.,S
1113,it's also all the source is available.,S
1115,right.,B
1138,and so,F
1139,uh that's a nice feature.,S
1145,you you know there's also the the user interface that's missing.,S
1147,it's missing from all of our offices.,S
1168,i i just don't know how much it's worth doing.,S
1234,appreciate it.,S
1238,yeah.,B
1286,so i was saying like and i could label this one left.,S
1292,but really no uh you know in the context if you know he can't hear what he's saying,D
1303,but but if you knew that that i wasn't actually in the room and that dan wasn't talking to me it it became okay.,S
1307,and that's that's where i added comments.,S
1321,i should rewrite the mix tool to put half the people in one channel and half in the other.,S
1330,okay.,S
1333,i was just going to ask uh so i just wanted to sort of finish off the question i had about backchannels.,S
1365,and so then uh in terms of like words like uh and um i just wrote them.,S
1415,actually it sounds like there might be a problem putting it into the software if the software only handles two parallel channels.,S
1427,and if there are five five people speaking at once,D
1443,but,F
1444,right.,S
1481,sometimes we had the situation which is you know which you which you get in conversations of someone continuing someone else's utterance.,S
1521,i you know i did this i did this transcription.,S
1576,is there,D
1600,no.,F
1601,the,D
1612,i'd like to be able to to pore through you know the the types of conventions that you've come up with and stuff like that.,S
1646,if you just did a crappy job nobody would want you to do it.,S
1649,let's look at it anyway.,S
1672,right.,S
1720,most of the web sites i do aren't that complex.,S
1723,no i think,D
1741,well,F
1742,send me links.,S
1769,um let's move on to electronics.,S
1777,but i all i could i couldn't find it at the local store.,S
1815,and so this is the box's,D
1834,excuse me.,S
1843,right.,S
1848,and so the you we just epoxy them down or something.,S
1852,and even though there's eight cables they're not really very big around.,S
1890,that's really cruel.,S
1892,so that,D
1912,dot dot dot.,S
1929,right.,S
1944,and uh it's function is to to uh essentially a wire converter to go from these little blue wires to these black wires.,S
1974,there will be a certain amount of looking at cables has to be done if people uh rewire things.,S
1977,yeah i mean we i had that last time.,S
2010,well i was wrestling with with literally the number of connectors in the cable and the the uh powering system.,S
2036,you understand what i'm,D
2041,and i can certainly build it out of oak.,S
2050,and it's total crap.,S
2059,so yeah i i guess it's just a question is that something you want to spend your time on.,S
2074,the uh the flat panels.,S
2086,uh,F
2087,then the other question is do we want to try to do a user interface that's available out here.,S
2125,yeah no no i'm i i i ain't joking here.,S
2159,um,F
2160,right so it's just a question of getting a laptop and a wireless modem.,S
2184,i thought it just came through a serial or an ethernet port.,S
2190,the question is is there an apple driver.,S
2192,yeah i'm sure.,S
2195,but the two,D
2234,sure.,S
2284,yeah.,B
2292,well that sounds like a good solution one way or the other.,S
2309,when people talk it they go on and off.,S
2316,using using these,D
2363,oh.,S
1,so,F
2,uh today we're looking at a number of uh things we're trying.,S
19,yeah i could perhaps draw this on the blackboard.,S
66,there's there's no low low pass processing used as additional feature stream.,S
70,do you um they mentioned made some uh when i was on the phone with sunil they they mentioned some weighting scheme that was used to evaluate all of these numbers.,S
81,generally what you observe with t i digits is that the result are very close whatever the the system.,S
107,there is something funny happening here because,D
125,oh we can't do it.,S
131,too bad.,S
135,except i don't know because they i think they are still working well.,S
139,yeah.,F
140,if we had time perhaps we could try to find uh some kind of compromise between the delay that's on the handset and on the server side.,S
143,but well huh for the moment they have this large delay on the the feature computation and so we don't,D
146,all right so for now at least that's not there.,S
153,yeah.,F
154,and uh let's see.,F
160,oh i see yeah that that one you can't use because of the delay.,S
170,actually the yeah the second line is uh pretty much like the first line in yellow.,S
175,yeah.,B
184,and little worse on the on the m m case.,S
186,uh well yeah it's worse than a few things.,S
212,yeah.,B
220,i don't remember.,S
231,yeah.,S
260,yeah.,B
280,it the the output silence of the m l p.,S
297,and we not we are not sure if we pick we have the silence.,S
307,right but i mean what's the what does the last row mean?,S
314,so this is like the second line but with with the combo stuff.,S
322,okay so,F
323,all right.,F
324,so it looks to me i guess the same.,S
330,huh.,B
342,so if we can know what how many words are in each.,S
376,yeah.,B
378,uh yeah well.,F
379,well basically it's this with perhaps some kind of printing and some some other.,S
383,uhhuh.,B
390,uhhuh.,B
393,the my what in this in this situation is my forte which is english.,S
396,huh.,B
411,this is probably channel error stuff.,S
421,right.,F
422,it's presumed there's all sorts of tuning that's gone on on the what they call seen databases.,S
428,so they splitting up between the t i digits and everything else i see.,S
445,so we're doing that also i guess.,S
471,because i i think,D
474,or i don't know.,S
478,is but is is it i thought it was actually something like five p m on,D
526,uhhuh.,B
550,yeah.,B
557,okay.,F
558,well i i think i see where we are and everybody knows what they're doing and is there is there anything else we should talk about?,S
563,so basically we will i think we'll try to to focus on these three architectures.,S
579,we'd have to schedule it.,S
583,it's uh,D
586,so in some ways he just got his payback.,S
591,well uh you guys doing great stuff so that's that that's really neat.,S
593,we'll uh uh don't think we need to uh,D
600,uh dave and i were just talking about that a little while ago.,S
605,okay i'll start.,S
1,welcome to our next meeting.,S
8,furthermore as most of you know i will leave in tenth of december.,S
15,then furthermore i would like to know the status of everybody.,S
29,so that is my current opinion concerning how siemens deal with with my uh ongoing effort.,S
34,in principle in his spare time.,S
58,the,F
59,oh.,S
92,that's okay for me.,S
100,no promises.,S
127,so i think it's related to the work um they've done on sunday here.,S
146,uhhuh.,B
148,you download it if that must be possible from the network.,S
162,and the alumni page in principle we have to,D
175,but um,F
176,i think everybody should take a look to the web pages and inform claudia if something uh has to be improved or if there's some comments.,S
179,uh,F
180,he's laughing all the time.,S
194,i have announced in the project area the major headlines.,S
202,um,F
203,then the next point is then this active routing stuff.,S
205,i would like to discuss it before.,S
209,okay.,S
211,i believe it must be adjusted to the current activities a little bit more.,S
214,i i think it doesn't,D
262,so,F
263,okay.,S
266,i don't know.,F
267,you maybe you can also read through the all the text which is on the web pages.,S
273,um,F
274,but anyways.,F
275,so i tried to do this today.,S
292,no.,S
295,maybe we can we can uh translate the white color into transparent color.,S
307,that's these are some things i have to do.,S
309,and if you have something which i should put on the web page for you,D
311,yeah some pictures will be nice.,S
314,yeah it depends on how much time you have.,S
348,yeah.,S
351,another point's like uh what about the bank.,S
354,another point.,S
363,that's the point.,S
368,yeah but at least then it should be huh i think be uh i.c.s.i. part and not network restricted.,S
387,maybe i talk with jane about this.,S
409,but that could still be applicable if you put it under the icsi site if you take the responsibility for that.,S
431,but i think that's an administration problem and that everybody agrees that the information page must be on the general on the highest level.,S
435,but,F
436,but i think we discuss if still,D
451,yes.,S
488,and if we have some talks from exterm and we had some in the past we can also put the slides on on these things.,S
495,that's and i think it's a great idea from claudia to to have this event page.,S
498,no it's easy to to add it.,S
501,yeah.,S
504,if there are no events then there are no events.,S
524,yeah.,S
540,let's consider update event button.,S
542,so and then the next point and i believe yeah so not the last one is one that i would like to know the status as far it is possible from everybody concerning his future intention here at i.c.s.i. or whether when he will leave whether he can or will he consider currently uh contribute here to the proposal.,S
575,i don't think so.,S
596,but i think even also k.p.n. is lost for the uh for the i.c.s.i.,S
603,um so from your side the statement is um that uh independently of your person uh the k.p.n. is not they're not willing to send us another guy here to i.c.s.i. anyway.,S
614,k.p.n. and and i.c.s.i. in principle.,S
647,well uh,F
648,even later if uh there is some interesting work uh going on.,S
702,we have uh other students are which are uh huh people that has a grant.,S
711,it's not sure.,S
726,but the main thing is that there is a uh this big difference.,S
736,yeah i think so too.,S
755,in the relation of u.s.a.i.a.i. also have the activities with georgia tech.,S
767,but i think we will uh detail these things then in one of the last meetings.,S
769,how is your status and and your ideas and your plans and your future and,D
772,i will,D
778,afterwards um at berlin i'm yeah funded by an institution of the german government.,S
780,they are paying me.,S
787,on the other hand there are also uh some students or,D
789,at the moment it's quite difficult to find students uh who are doing their master's thesis and so on.,S
792,about two years ago the numbers of students were um studying computer science uh started to increase again.,S
797,so hopefully this work will be go on.,S
807,it's some of pre stage to that.,S
817,but oder?,D
823,we want to we started to collect information to write the paper about quality of serving routing for m.p.l.s. in an m.p.l.s. domain.,S
866,my last point uh in principle is the proposal itself.,S
868,i know in the past it was always if i'm not writing something nothing going to happen.,S
913,everybody's waiting.,S
920,it's a pity that multicast is in principle removed.,S
925,but neverless we have to live with this situation.,S
943,then we can extend the proposal one more time with multicast.,S
946,no i mean that,D
948,i i i think that it cannot uh be uh considered the first type task to do.,S
953,if,D
960,i do not mean to drop it to remove the text from the proposal.,S
970,yeah.,S
973,no no.,S
1,uh,B
24,there are here are uh the results.,S
26,and i will not,D
29,and um,F
30,the reading was five minutes exactly.,S
106,yes.,S
109,there's no female equivalent of,D
116,yeah that's what i was thinking but,D
121,uh,F
122,and um,F
123,so some some work needs to be done but i think we can uh,D
127,great.,F
128,so first of all i agree that um we should hire fey and start paying her.,S
137,so anyway,F
138,um,F
143,well yeah she's she's not a a student.,S
146,huh.,B
171,yep.,B
174,great.,S
178,well as i say there is this set of people next door it's not hard to,D
182,however we may run into a problem with a reading task there.,S
185,we could talk to the people who run it and um see if they have a way that they could easily uh tell people that there's a task pays ten bucks or something.,S
196,my idea on that was uh partly we'll talk about system stuff for the computer scientists.,S
242,so let's let's,D
252,so basically all i did was i took the last belief net.,S
298,now.,S
307,so what,D
331,because i don't understand how it would work otherwise.,S
336,well i oh yeah i i understand that.,S
341,uh,F
342,there there are a variety of ways of doing it.,S
347,there're ways to uh sort of back off on the purity of your bayes-net-edness.,S
357,so,F
358,so in that case the we'd have we,D
363,so what i was going to say is is maybe a good at this point is to try to informally,D
381,and,F
397,uh,F
398,well i think this is still i mean ad hoc.,S
416,and a very simple thing.,S
432,you're you're,D
456,ultimately.,S
502,right.,F
503,but it's not construction there it's action.,S
544,and that's so getting back to here.,S
560,right.,S
566,and then it would have values uh tour business or uh hurried.,S
575,the probabilities of both of them happening at the same time,D
584,the each of these things is going to be a a a probability.,S
587,so like landmark ness and usefulness.,S
634,i think that's i think that's exactly right.,S
665,i think we i i can come up with a a code for a module that we call the cognitive dispatcher which does nothing.,S
673,then,D
677,this this is not a complaint this is a promise to do more work.,S
694,yep.,B
696,maybe we,D
708,it uh,D
712,i'm not a i'm not particularly opposed to adding that or any other task.,S
717,i'm just saying that i'm going to have to do some sort of first principles thinking about this.,S
760,it's unfortunate also that english has sort of got rid of most of its spatial adverbs.,S
763,well you have prepositional phrases that,D
774,oh yeah!,S
793,yeah that was my,D
801,yeah and and and yeah and and she took it seriously and stuff.,S
817,right.,B
823,okay.,S
30,you can see the transcript.,S
37,again i'm not sure how much i should talk about stuff before everyone's here.,S
51,yeah that's good.,S
53,so everyone needs to fill out only once the speaker form and the consent form.,S
59,on the speaker form just fill out as much of the information as you can.,S
65,and i think that's about it.,S
95,um it uh,F
96,i don't know a good way of doing it on the audio and still have people who are doing discourse research be able to use the data.,S
172,either one of those.,S
213,we could pursue um if we thought it's it's worth it but uh i think we we will agree on that um to come up with a with a sort of very very first crude prototype.,S
217,focus on that object down,D
254,okay i this um these intentions we we could if we want to call it the the vista mode.,S
328,my suggestion is really simple.,S
384,and this is in general it's going to be true of any kind of deep understanding.,S
407,so that the the output of the belief net is pretty well formed.,S
448,yeah.,S
492,they call it intention hypotheses.,S
519,because um sometimes people just say things.,S
534,still outcome the outcome will be some form of structure.,S
568,but,F
569,go go back to the the uh,D
613,we need a different uh engine.,S
630,i guess,D
659,not from that data.,S
712,but you know,D
714,and i think the other concern that has come up before too is if it's,D
716,i don't know if this was collected what situation this data was collected in.,S
725,no not,D
750,i'm sure we can produce some if we need it.,S
779,um first thing is you have to read a text about heidelberg.,S
820,so in the display you can oh you said that you you might have a display that shows like the,D
878,uhhuh.,D
882,maybe the maybe what you're suggesting,D
925,so that's so nancy we'll have at some point we'll have another discussion on exactly you know how that's going to go.,S
953,the the problem that i was going to try to focus on today was let's suppose by magic you could collect dialogues in which one way or the other you were able to uh figure out both the intention.,S
991,all these,D
1034,probably that's not worth it.,S
1074,there's the tool kit that um kevin murphy has developed.,S
1085,yeah i know him.,S
1095,um so if it has that i.o. capability and if it's a java package it will definitely be able we can couple.,S
1105,all of these things have been built with much bigger projects than this in mind.,S
1122,you know feature value x.m.l. format is probably as good a way as any.,S
1159,it's uh,F
1160,it doesn't control what you do you know internally.,S
1176,i was actually more joking with the two or three days.,S
1198,right yeah.,S
1216,so this is while you were doing this i received two lovely emails.,S
1275,so this was actually an actual problem that we encountered.,S
4,going again.,S
10,that's if these are anonymized.,S
12,oh okay.,S
15,uh anyway.,S
24,okay.,B
33,uh and uh then uh talk a little bit about about disks and resource resource issues that that's starting to get worked out.,S
42,yeah that's good.,S
52,plenty of electrons left there.,S
54,so um,F
55,uh,F
56,okay.,F
57,so uh i wanted to start this with this mundane thing.,S
59,uh i i it was it was kind of my bright idea to have us take a plane that leaves at seven twenty in the morning.,S
61,oh yeah that's right.,S
83,oh boy!,S
85,so,F
92,i guess once you get past the bridge that that would be the worst.,S
114,so,F
115,great.,S
117,so that'll,D
126,you're staying overnight.,S
131,that's sort of one night.,S
133,anyway.,F
134,so six a m in front.,S
136,six a m in front.,S
147,okay.,F
148,that was the real real important stuff.,S
164,okay.,S
166,so the h t k base lines so this is using mel cepstra and so on.,S
168,yeah.,S
170,and again i guess the the plan is uh to uh then given this,D
191,well what we want to do is first we have number for each uh task.,S
197,yeah so,D
213,yeah but the the idea is to compute the feature before the before sending them to the,D
219,oh i see.,S
235,well nnn,F
236,but i'm not sure,D
253,well actually for the moment if we do not want to use these phone databases we we already have uh english spanish and french uh with microphone speech.,S
255,uhhuh.,B
260,yeah.,S
268,well we also have this broadcast news that we were talking about taking off the disk which is is microphone data for for english.,S
300,you think so.,S
325,well,F
326,well,F
327,but no but you you pick up the phone.,S
332,so the phone doesn't know what a what what your language is.,S
341,it could be.,S
361,yeah so i don't i know unfortunately i don't i see what you're where you're coming from i think.,S
368,yeah.,S
370,there's there's uh,D
387,yeah.,B
398,so,F
399,uh and they aren't you know with the exception of finnish which i guess it's pretty different from most most things.,S
412,the,D
424,without without any licensing big deals or anything like that.,S
429,but i'm am i,D
441,and and the inputs are p l p and delta and that sort of thing.,S
458,so so you take p l p and you you uh do it uh you you uh use h t k with it with the transformed features using a neural net that's trained.,S
469,maybe.,S
472,uhhuh.,B
474,i mean those listening to this will not have a picture either.,S
516,you know i i i guess i'm sounding cavalier.,S
548,it's it's definitely broader.,S
550,but actually the issue of uh phoneme mappings will arise when we will do use several languages.,S
598,well we have that now too right?,S
607,so actually maybe now you've got me sort of intrigued.,S
620,okay.,S
639,well.,F
640,uh he can't actually.,S
642,but,D
649,and,F
650,the last dimension happens to be,D
663,so let's see.,S
677,multi band.,S
688,and then multi band after networks meaning.,S
691,and using the the outputs of these networks or the linear outputs or something like that.,S
693,yeah.,F
703,uhhuh.,S
705,well,F
706,not for the the a n n.,S
710,we could we could add m f c c also.,S
717,conceptually it makes sense as a as a base line.,S
763,yeah.,S
768,um,F
769,oh yeah.,S
796,okay.,F
797,and then we have uh um broader broader corpus um like timit.,S
817,okay.,S
853,and the french from france.,S
856,no the french is yeah from uh paris.,S
872,and um,F
873,within the training corporas um we're uh thinking about um training with noise.,S
875,incorporating the same kinds of noises that um aurora is incorporating in their um in their training corpus.,S
891,yeah.,B
896,uhhuh.,B
908,yeah.,S
915,the spanish perhaps.,S
927,yeah.,S
931,they are preparing.,S
934,okay.,F
935,so uh,F
936,yeah.,F
937,something like seven things in each uh each column.,S
941,so that's,D
952,i'm just kidding.,S
957,type a type b and type c.,S
965,also we can clean that,D
970,um,F
971,yeah.,S
1006,so i mean,F
1007,you don't want to,D
1009,let's see.,S
1012,it's not a complete set of combinations though.,S
1022,there's,D
1025,yeah.,S
1030,yeah.,F
1031,when you do that you're increasing the size of the inputs to the net.,S
1034,i mean,F
1035,so it doesn't increase the number of trainings.,S
1052,so there's not really a limit.,S
1058,okay.,B
1060,uh i think the computation isn't so much of a problem.,S
1065,uhhuh.,B
1067,but yeah.,F
1068,i was just realizing that actually it doesn't explode out.,S
1070,it's not really two to the seventh.,S
1075,uh if you have all of these nets trained some place then uh you can combine their outputs and do the k l transformation and so forth.,S
1077,uhhuh.,B
1082,uh,F
1083,right.,F
1084,i mean it's just running the data through.,S
1096,uh,F
1097,one would think one net.,S
1099,but we've i don't think we've tested that.,S
1107,so i guess the first thing is if if we know how much a how long a a training takes.,S
1116,which is a little bit.,S
1123,but there is the testing also which implies training uh the h t k models.,S
1126,the h t k model.,S
1140,more than six hours.,S
1157,i don't know what ravioli is.,S
1170,i guess.,S
1178,and it,D
1180,so,F
1181,i mean,F
1182,clearly there's no way we can even begin to do any significant amount here unless we use multiple machines.,S
1194,well you have a,D
1200,it's let's say it's six hours or eight hours or something for the training of h t k.,S
1204,i would say two days.,S
1218,i i think the neural net spert.,S
1221,yes.,S
1250,so this is,D
1252,i kind of like this because what it,D
1259,so with very limited time we actually have really quite a quite a bit of computational resource available.,S
1262,on the other hand almost anything that really you know is is new where we're saying well let's look at like we were talking before about uh uh voiced-unvoiced-silence detection features and all those sort that's,D
1280,and uh then you know set it up in terms of scripts and so forth and uh in in kind some kind of structured way.,S
1282,um and you know when we go to uh o g i next week uh we can then present to them you know what it is that we're doing.,S
1288,and uh,F
1289,then uh like we're there.,S
1316,yeah.,B
1320,i begin to work with the italian database to nnn to with the front end and with the h t k program and the.,S
1336,so it's it's it's a little messier.,S
1343,um and i think to to to recognize the italian digits with the neural spanish neural network.,S
1369,okay.,F
1370,oh also that,D
1382,so you're just having a problem converting the labels.,S
1393,huh.,B
1416,we have a lot more computational capability here than they do at o g i.,S
1425,i i was thinking two things.,S
1454,i still think we could do a lot of them.,S
1459,but a hundred is a lot.,S
1461,okay.,B
1463,yeah.,B
1471,i mean my point,D
1477,we're over the next year or two we're going to be upgrading the networks in this place.,S
1486,now we are getting more disk for the central file server.,S
1490,you put them all in the central at the central file server.,S
1499,we're,D
1501,it's going to take us a couple weeks at least to get the uh uh the amount of disk we're going to be getting we're actually going to get.,S
1507,but uh,F
1508,we've put another i guess there's another eighteen gigabytes that's that's in there now to help us with the immediate crunch.,S
1510,are you saying,D
1518,well,F
1519,to,D
1535,huh.,B
1537,haven't been haven't been doing much computing personally.,S
1539,um,F
1540,yeah.,S
1555,right right.,S
1579,and so that's the kind of thing where like if um okay if you don't have an n t but you have a a a unix workstation and they attach an external disk it'll be called slash x something uh if it's not backed up.,S
1596,yeah.,S
1606,uhhuh.,B
1616,um i've been going through and copying data that is you know some kind of corpus stuff usually that that we've got on a c d rom or something onto that new disk to free up space on other disks.,S
1620,uh but we i would like to go through sit down with you about some of these other ones and see if we can move them onto um this new disk also.,S
1627,um,F
1628,so far i've i've copied a couple of things.,S
1631,and i haven't looked at the any of the aurora stuff.,S
1636,yeah.,F
1637,i i just,D
1640,well we were thinking about using this systematically for all the experiments.,S
1644,but,D
1646,so that this could be another dimension.,S
1659,so that it's plausible for the final thing.,S
1662,so i guess,D
1667,you know maybe have it be somewhat visual little bit.,S
1671,so we can say what we're doing.,S
1677,anything else that,D
1684,okay.,B
1687,all right.,F
1688,and uh and the other the the last topic i had here was um uh dave's fine offer to to uh do something on this.,S
1693,yeah.,F
1694,i was thinking perhaps if um additionally to all these experiments which is not really research.,S
1717,that's a good thing you remove the mike.,S
1721,uh,F
1722,what an additional clever person could help with when we're really in a crunch for time.,S
1730,over years if he's if he's interested in you know voiced-unvoiced-silence he could do a lot.,S
1737,so that that's the question.,S
1743,yes.,S
1751,yeah.,S
1753,uh,F
1754,yeah.,S
1763,or you know a so so job.,S
1778,um,F
1779,and the other tricky thing is since we are,D
1790,um,F
1791,so uh,F
1792,so i think,D
1801,um creating the the superset.,S
1804,uh creating a superset from looking at the multiple languages.,S
1817,so you'd have to create a mapping from each language to the superset.,S
1825,carmen was talking about this sampa thing.,S
1828,and um they they have a web site that stephane was showing us that has um has all the english phonemes and their sampa correspondent um phoneme.,S
1859,aha.,S
1874,and yeah.,F
1875,and the result was that apparently when testing on cross language it was better.,S
1879,but,D
1902,i see.,S
1904,right.,S
1912,yeah.,B
1915,yeah.,S
1936,they were talking about perhaps.,S
1938,but they,D
1953,uh the second class way of doing it is to look at the uh phones that are labeled.,S
1959,articulatory feature.,S
1965,you either do that or you have multiple nets.,S
1967,i see.,S
1969,and um,F
1970,i don't know if our software this if the versions of the quicknet that we're using allows for that.,S
1976,we have gotten soft targets to to work.,S
1983,that's another thing that could be done.,S
1986,now the fact even though it's a smaller number it's still fine.,S
1998,um,F
1999,i mean if your net is going to be outputting uh a vector of basically of,D
2004,i don't know if you know this for your testing data.,S
2018,and they they had done a cheating experiment or something right?,S
2022,well hynek said that that i guess before they had him work on this they had done some experiment where if they could get that one feature right it dramatically improved the result.,S
2053,nonlinearity.,S
2067,i think i think apparently the uh,D
2076,if you're going to do a k l transform on it.,S
1,thanks very much for coming.,S
3,so um,F
4,let's see.,S
10,huh.,B
16,so um,F
17,it struck me that um you know we could start out with some sort of general thing about um things that you found easier or more difficult with respect to transcribing or checking or using the interface or uh dealing with the time bins or any aspect of that type.,S
22,so,F
23,maybe we could just um start with issues of the the up there at the top of,D
32,i don't know very much about this kind of stuff.,S
39,parentheses meaning uncertainty.,S
59,especially when describing like the set up in this room also and the different types of mikes.,S
62,uhhuh.,B
86,some of them just occurred over and over the again.,S
95,uhhuh.,B
145,i liked them.,S
163,um,F
164,i forget who it was that i was transcribing.,S
171,i was getting a little frustrated.,S
189,you know.,F
190,uh somebody who speaks like chinese or something.,S
201,and then i've worked with larry hyman on like some of the bantu languages.,S
203,uhhuh.,B
234,but,D
248,there was a couple of different spanish speakers.,S
256,and i can't really answer that.,S
262,oh yeah.,S
265,and i've taken lots,D
268,um when i when i correct it i can i can tell that the person who um transcribed it before me probably didn't speak spanish.,S
291,right.,B
327,uhhuh.,B
362,yeah i had the same experience.,S
386,you know she was from probably continental spain versus you know other spanish.,S
412,and in my case with with uh german i a certain region that i do well in.,S
425,and,D
443,and it was kind of it was very hard to transcribe.,S
458,uhhuh.,B
462,because that's definitely something that i wouldn't have be able to do.,S
487,or they're laughing when they're talking.,S
494,or just,D
503,uhhuh.,B
526,right.,S
536,oh good to know.,S
542,so that was you're talking about early on the change into channeltrans.,S
568,and you had to mark interruptions by a slash.,S
574,overlaps.,S
586,wow that's difficult.,S
602,that's possible.,S
609,well it's,D
628,huh.,B
634,yeah.,B
641,you know.,F
642,in the,D
669,i always adjust the time bins.,S
698,i mean i usually ended adjusting them a little bit.,S
701,definitely when something's cut off at the beginning or the end.,S
733,the the g it was pronounced as a k.,S
745,that's kind of interesting.,S
756,yeah.,B
793,i like that.,S
804,i i don't remember the words exactly.,S
808,if you connected it all together it completely changed what was right before it and what was right after it.,S
821,and maybe the pause was just so short that it made up a pause.,S
824,there are some times when there have been words that they just pause right in the middle of.,S
831,it i'm sure sometimes on purpose.,S
838,uhhuh.,B
841,uh there's,D
861,it you guys are getting so good that it's like i'm i i i can get through them faster and i'm getting to the point where i maybe don't have to go through them all the way.,S
867,and so i'm not going to be checking them all i don't think in the for throughout the whole rest of the project.,S
869,certainly have spot checking.,S
933,and some people just say kay.,S
935,yeah.,S
1018,right.,S
1022,i don't usually get,D
1028,yeah that came up a couple of times.,S
1030,yeah.,B
1033,i agree.,S
1063,i mean i can only think of like two or three occasions where i sat and thought about it for a while.,S
1067,it's okay.,S
1078,you know if there's interesting uh hypotheses that the that have been suggested to you by looking at the data.,S
1081,hnh.,B
1101,okay.,S
1114,thanks.,S
1155,yeah so we'll survive.,S
1162,so um,F
1163,oh.,S
1181,uh moving from having the first transcription done by an external service and then you correcting that versus doing the initial transcription yourselves.,S
1238,no.,S
1248,no.,S
1253,i didn't either.,S
1289,the ones that say i b m are like they actually say i b m.,S
1321,is,D
1394,oh okay.,S
1396,let's see.,F
1397,they hear them,D
1403,and especially you can see if you have like four speakers it be you can maybe find a way of doing that.,S
1436,um,F
1437,um there are cases where you'll get a segment and it's someone else's utterance.,S
1478,they're very fast.,S
1505,uhhuh.,B
1511,i would not be as thorough.,S
1536,but i mean it's still it's still cool.,S
1540,yeah i did i did like actually doing the transcribing a little bit more.,S
1549,and when you're when you're um just checking you're you're usually just looking for certain things that you know are going to come up.,S
1564,yeah i really do.,S
1575,like i i change time bins a lot.,S
1581,so i guess i don't see too much of a difference.,S
1604,i'm,D
1648,yeah that's right.,S
1699,you can hear there's like.,S
1707,yeah.,S
1722,because everyone's laughing.,S
1744,have you noticed that,D
1749,yeah yeah.,S
1787,i remember transcribing one person.,S
1793,i think i know who you're talking about.,S
1796,but then some people tend to,D
1819,i sort of end up feeling like i know these people better than i really do.,S
1837,if you're in the meeting yourself then you of course you'd have access to all this information and all your inferences about you know whether they're funny or not funny or whatever.,S
1866,neat.,S
1870,yeah yeah yeah.,F
1871,nice guy.,S
1883,yeah i'm sure you've seen her.,S
1885,uh but,F
1886,i must have.,S
1890,yeah i think she's got a nice voice.,S
1893,yeah.,B
1911,i mean it's like,D
1919,it's it's very interesting the ambience that you can get through these these little things.,S
1927,and then you can,D
1964,i just i start zoning out sometimes.,S
1985,yeah.,S
2030,wow.,S
2061,gets coffee.,S
2074,that's good.,S
2077,so we still technically,D
2092,so um,F
2093,let's see.,F
2094,i had something that i could bring up.,S
2097,as far as ideas about looking at the data and getting ideas about whatever you said hypotheses about how to figure it out.,S
2106,huh.,B
2122,do you people,D
2145,i don't necessarily do it as often as the one speaker i'm thinking of.,S
2147,but i do do that because,D
2204,but that's not really an example of this.,S
2239,that's cool.,S
2256,or,D
2294,if you,D
2317,so the one i'm thinking of is like if like ha ha.,S
2321,so he's laughing.,S
2331,kind of like uh.,S
2361,but it just seems like it's more prominent than,D
2373,yeah like let's come back to the original subject.,S
2375,and i will take it from there.,S
2399,so you don't offend me about how good my joke was.,S
2401,it's almost like okay.,S
2420,yeah.,S
2502,i and he's they they have this nice mutual condescending joking thing going on.,S
2509,and then at one point she you know at another meeting she she was not sure which channel she was on.,S
2535,well so do we would would we could do digits if we so desired.,S
2573,yeah.,B
2608,i guess it would be,D
2623,sometimes when people are reading zero they say o.,S
2701,i would say don't worry about that.,S
2706,the uh the interface that these guys used uh allows you to set the time boundaries really accurately.,S
2713,okay so,F
2737,we just start out we and you you say transcript l whatever it is.,S
19,it seemed like there were still some issues.,S
55,well our argument was everybody has access to our code and everybody always had access to our code.,S
138,that's what that's a very good uh point.,S
143,if you of course if you put a zero uh weight zero on a mismatched condition or highly mismatched then then you are done.,S
148,well of course people will not like it.,S
226,i mean,D
336,but it's but for but for instance uh uh what what uh humans are very much capable of doing is that if if they are exactly the same thing happening in two neighboring critical bands recognition can discard it.,S
367,but if you if you if you modulate the noise the masking goes up and the moment you start hitting the another critical band the masking goes down.,S
375,huh.,B
435,so,F
436,huh.,B
458,what i think would be of course extremely useful if we can come to our next meeting and say well you know we did get fifty percent improvement.,S
482,i guess it could be even better.,S
499,and harry said yeah.,S
528,huh.,B
530,so but this is being now discussed right now.,S
547,we are around fifty fifty five.,S
550,yeah.,B
556,i don't know exactly if it's,D
563,but,F
564,uhhuh.,F
565,huh.,B
569,finally we we've not finished with this.,S
627,so,F
628,morgan was and he was he was saying well this might be the alternative way how to play with a with a fudge factor.,S
645,so we were coming with all these various lifters.,S
664,if you were at bell labs or i,D
676,but i wonder if there isn't some way of doing this uh search like when we are searching say for best discriminants.,S
686,everything is fixed.,S
763,it's the same same mean.,S
828,i see what you are saying.,S
832,uh no no i don't think that it would be the same.,S
887,so you so so you may want to do it other way around.,S
920,but i mean but it's it's it's do able.,S
996,chuck is getting himself in trouble.,S
1000,huh!,F
1049,it's it's this thing that's the shape of a bird and it has a red ball and its beak dips into the water.,S
1069,yeah.,B
1087,so they got in trouble.,S
1089,huh!,S
1136,exactly.,S
1154,yeah,B
1249,he said that it was like it was like just so many libraries and nobody knew what was used when.,S
1257,well the the only thing i would check is if he does he use intel math libraries.,S
1266,yeah.,B
1286,well there are at least there are optimized version for their architecture.,S
1307,hynek i don't know if you've ever done this.,S
1,so welcome to our next meeting.,S
21,it works like like this.,S
37,uh,F
38,well the research topics at this moment is uh i.p. eighty traffic monitoring and characterization and them uh tool developing tools uh for quality of service uh performance analysis.,S
46,uh,F
47,maybe it was my fault that i assumed that the pointer of miguel concerning u.m.t.s. services was deployed to everybody.,S
51,maybe we it's a homework in principle for the next meeting to get a little bit familiar with these things.,S
54,so i believe we will not have today a very hard technical discussion.,S
62,okay.,S
80,end to end communication is sometimes uh done by direct communication from one node to the other.,S
85,an intermediate or a set of intermediate nodes will route or will forward the packet from the sender to the destination.,S
87,uh in a sense what we have in this kind of networks is that uh nodes are as both arced as both uh endpoints and also routers of other neighboring nodes.,S
112,here you have several several uh proposed uh scenarios for for used this networks.,S
122,higher area could be covered could be explored.,S
131,these sensors can be for example uh checking that there is no fire.,S
140,well,F
141,you know it's an interesting question.,S
167,okay.,S
174,uh you know and finally uh another nonmilitary applications where uh maybe a network is available like for example a room like this.,S
188,the point or or the question could be for some of us the idea of saying okay.,S
194,it it seems that probably that the problem is is not an easy one.,S
252,no.,S
259,this is what is called a hidden terminal problem.,S
267,well some some protocols have been developed to avoid this problem and to try to address this particular behavior of wireless transmissions.,S
270,we are um reserving a certain and a specific uh area of space so we can guarantee that nobody is trying to use the same space at the same time.,S
272,this is the basic idea.,S
275,yeah.,S
289,of course this is only intended for unicast transmissions.,S
303,yes.,S
311,in fact forcing the receiver to transmit for a short period of time is also uh used to signal all the uh receiver neighbors that a a reception is taking place.,S
314,i didn't get it.,S
334,so it's only related to the direct neighbor within the scope of the transmissions.,S
356,fine.,S
359,if that way we can warranty that there is there are there is no collision uh uh between data packet well this this is this means a a huge uh increase in network throughput.,S
373,if reservation doesn't work okay if uh one reservation don't succeed then uh this transmission should have to wait.,S
415,if now two has uh huh answer with the with the c.t.s. it will be waiting until the data that has to come.,S
453,you cannot usually you cannot uh read the data packet until you the reception is over.,S
466,um a further question.,S
469,that's okay.,S
488,in fact this node will avoid any further transmission until uh this reception that will start in in a moment is over.,S
534,okay.,F
535,and in fact uh there is another detail.,S
540,when you hear one uh c.t.s. or one uh r.t.s. packet you know that the frame that they are trying to transmit or that this one is trying to transmit this one is about to receive you know the length.,S
566,yeah.,F
567,but the but in this case you know this this idea this uh geometric idea can be can be if you want uh deformed because of some obstacles.,S
573,if they,D
579,okay.,F
580,so that was my question.,S
598,uhhuh.,B
603,in a,D
638,but this this this is not our scenario.,S
640,in our scenario all the nodes are exactly the same.,S
646,this is not a problem for us.,S
650,you know the idea is that this mechanism is a reservation mechanism.,S
656,our first uh work in this area was to study different mechanisms to try to adjust these transmission values.,S
668,first point what we have proposed is a way to obtain the transmission range uh for uh for an escenario where we know the number of nodes.,S
713,these guys are doing uh what they call uh b. connected networks.,S
741,in one,D
772,okay.,S
782,it should be something ipsh,D
785,thirty meters per second.,S
811,uh even if nodes are completely static uh some problems will happen in the wireless transmission.,S
813,we won't have a hundred percent uh perfect uh channel anyway.,S
819,that's really right.,S
843,in fact uh nnn some people proposing this mechanism is is showing a a a big improvement.,S
893,but again uh you know uh the the,D
937,okay.,S
961,at the end of the road we have to uh look for some tradeoffs to avoid too much uh interference at the receivers.,S
967,the frame error rate or the bit error rate uh skyrockets.,S
984,at this moment there are i would say a lot of proposals of different protocols uh for uh end to end traffic.,S
992,the problem here is that now uh one node is my neighbor.,S
998,if you let me a personal comment i think that one error on the group is not to agree a set of mobility patterns to to do the the tests.,S
1021,these proposals are are trying to get the advantages of both uh mechanisms.,S
1047,you can have the destinations you would like to or the in the i.p. addresses of the intermediate nodes you still know.,S
1053,this one is going then to this guy and so on and so on.,S
1062,okay i see.,S
1097,uh i'm sure that the proposals are okay.,S
1173,and miguel should i should ask you one question.,S
1225,you know,D
1238,slow signals.,S
1262,huh,F
1263,both uh dialing sequence and frequency hopping spread the spectrum techniques are also intended to provide uh interference uh less uh data transmission.,S
1271,assuming that another bluetooth or several bluetooth networks will be could be in the same area of space,D
1345,uhhuh.,B
1371,oh thanks michael for your computer.,S
1393,that's the proper answer.,S
1406,the the problem is that in principle we have different scopes.,S
1411,and um,F
1412,and um also based on that it belongs normally to one single provider domain that it is possible to to uh use novel things.,S
1449,i hope that everybody is doing his homework concerning for instance.,S
1474,yeah.,S
1548,but take a look to the slides i will uh deploy it um uh electronically.,S
1562,maybe the g.p.r.s. picture is still uh available.,S
1591,so i suggest now we will have in a few minutes we will have the coffee break tea cake whatever will will be offered.,S
3,there's two sheets of paper in front of us.,S
19,depending on if we put if we square the transfer function or not.,S
23,smoothing along frequency.,S
46,the uh one that has the smallest smaller overall number is actually better on the finnish and spanish.,S
52,um,F
53,huh,B
109,oh.,S
117,uh,F
154,uhhuh yeah.,S
226,so there's the neural net issue.,S
245,huh,B
247,and yeah it seems to us that this way of just dropping the beginning and end is not,D
264,yeah.,F
265,and another thing that we did also is that we have all this training data for let's say for speechdat car.,S
269,if we just take only the um v a d probabilities computed on the clean signal and apply them on the far field uh test utterances then results are much better.,S
304,yeah.,B
306,huh,B
340,and he says wiener filter is is forty milliseconds delay.,S
347,right.,S
354,that'd be good.,S
357,uh.,F
364,oh.,S
368,and um,F
381,but i think you know at this point our major concern is making the performance better.,S
435,oh that's a real good point.,S
443,i think it's okay.,S
457,if the net's on the server side then it could use all of the frames.,S
485,okay.,F
486,so uh,F
487,what's uh,D
497,so we uh actually i did the first experiment.,S
500,we take the first fifteen frame of each utterance to it.,S
504,i tried just plugging the um uh guenter noise estimation on this system.,S
507,but of course i didn't play with it.,S
510,uh i didn't do much more for noise estimation i just tried this.,S
512,huh yeah well it's not surprising it'd be worse the first time.,S
515,it does seem like you know some compromise between always depending on the first fifteen frames and always depending on a a pause is is is a good idea.,S
518,uhhuh.,B
520,yeah i guess.,S
523,no i mean,D
559,not using these methods anyway yeah.,S
571,um it'd certainly be more robust to different kinds of input if you had at least some updates.,S
573,uhhuh.,B
575,well i don't know.,S
583,uh,F
584,okay.,S
596,no.,B
648,um,F
649,and it seems important for like the on line normalization.,S
656,um,F
657,yeah so probably the v a d and and maybe testing out the noise estimation a little bit.,S
665,okay anything else?,S
683,uh so uh,F
684,uh the idea was that uh we'd we'd sort out where we were going next with this with this work before he uh left on this next trip.,S
687,huh,F
688,no just uh looking into some some of the things that um uh john ohala and hynek um gave as feedback.,S
691,in in my proposal i i was thinking about starting from a set of uh phonological features or a subset of them.,S
733,uh,F
5,just just to be consistent from here on in at least that that we'll do it at the end.,S
16,so we all forgot.,S
18,from last time i wanted to uh the an uh one topic from last time.,S
32,um so uh so i'll go through that.,S
38,sort of off topic i guess.,S
54,so it sounds like the the three main things that we have to talk about are uh this list uh jane and jane and adam have some research items and other than that anything as usual anything goes beyond that.,S
76,and it looked to me as though,D
126,yeah yeah.,D
192,yeah.,B
285,yep.,B
330,because since we were dealing with this full duplex sort of thing in switchboard where it was just all separated out we just everything was just nice.,S
337,depends what you're doing.,S
361,not you me.,S
402,it's but i don't know how high in fact.,S
450,what,D
467,right.,B
484,yeah.,S
494,so so actually um that's in part because the nodding if you have visual contact the nodding has the same function.,S
533,yeah.,B
574,but.,F
575,um.,F
576,you know the other thing i was thinking was that um these all these interesting questions are of course pretty hard to answer with uh you know a small amount of data.,S
594,yeah i'm just thinking that'd be more like a control condition.,S
634,to answer your question i it i don't think it's crucial to have controls.,S
640,i i have an idea.,S
656,or this is getting a little extravagant we could put up some kind of blinds or something to to remove uh visual contact.,S
678,yeah.,B
718,the chairs are chairs are movable.,S
790,okay.,B
833,it's uh just just trying to get some ground truth.,S
844,when you the detect the the the first at at the end of of the detector of um um.,S
903,i think like like uh uh a general uh uh way of process the the acoustic change.,S
911,uhhuh.,B
962,you have candidates.,S
972,but um i can imagine uh building a um model of speaker change detection that takes into account both the far field and the uh actually not just the close talking mike for that speaker but actually for all of for all of the speakers.,S
984,two to the n.,S
988,yeah.,B
1006,i i sorry.,S
1066,i still think we should try a a meeting or two with the blindfolds.,S
1088,blindfolds would be good.,S
1094,okay.,B
1102,um i i want to move this along.,S
1164,uh well you have to be careful about excising it how how you excise it.,S
1169,i i couldn't decide which was the right way to do it.,S
1181,i like that idea.,S
1189,yeah it's more obvious that there was something there than if there's just silence.,S
1196,right.,S
1262,and i wanted to say i think this is really interesting analysis.,S
22,and then you have,D
75,you're not talking about the entire page.,S
155,that's the only thought i have.,S
186,not very frequently.,S
195,and since this was something that liz asked for specifically i think we need to defer to her.,S
205,okay.,S
238,right.,B
249,so this was uh a uh proposal that we put in.,S
254,so is for it was a proposal for the i t r program.,S
261,so they're very competitive.,S
267,uh which was also true for the pre proposal.,S
269,uh there'll be bunch of people working on it.,S
276,and they said end of business day you could check on the reviewer forms.,S
334,huh.,B
352,see the small ones are less than five hundred thousand total over three years.,S
355,and the large ones are,D
357,boy i forget.,S
360,more than a million and a half more than two million or something like that.,S
366,i forget what it was.,S
368,uh i don't remember.,S
396,exactly what we say in the proposal.,S
400,none of it will go for those yachts that we've talking about.,S
403,no i mean it's,D
417,this is dealing with uh mapping on the level of of um the conversation.,S
423,so it's it's all stuff that none of us are doing right now.,S
429,yeah there there would be there would be new hires.,D
432,also there's always for everybody there's there's always things that are dropping off.,S
437,uhhuh.,B
452,then there's a third who's doing a project here.,S
456,maybe another will end up,D
476,same number of characters.,S
493,yeah well your example was really,D
523,that also brings up the point that we have to start assembling a speaker database so that we get those links back and forth.,S
526,and then uh the microphone issues.,S
536,uhhuh.,B
540,once i test them.,S
560,using an interface that has so much more complexity to it.,S
588,i don't know exactly where that's going at this point.,S
591,i really do think that it's wise that we've had them start the way we have.,S
594,having the interface that doesn't require them to do the uh the time bins for every single channel at a uh through the entire interaction.,S
599,once in a while a backchannel will be overlooked by the transcriber.,S
619,okay.,S
645,but uh,D
654,very much harmonics now.,S
658,uh and now i'm i'm i'm trying to to find uh some kind of a um of of help uh using the energy to to distinguish between possible harmonics and and other frequency peaks that uh not harmonics.,S
660,uh i have to to talk with with you with the group uh about the instantaneous frequency.,S
664,results similar results like uh the paper uh that i i am following.,S
670,yeah.,B
680,yeah but,D
696,the algorithm said that uh if you if you change the the the,D
698,the x the frequency x uh using the the instantaneous frequency.,S
716,yeah.,B
719,i would uh,D
723,only looking at the energy at multiples of the of that frequency.,S
745,i don't know what the right word is.,S
747,they're going to be dampened by the uh vocal tract.,S
756,i what you'd like to do is get rid of the effect of the vocal tract.,S
762,yeah that'd be good.,S
777,yeah i guess you could i guess,D
786,other than that i guess as far as the one person versus two persons it would be primarily a low frequency phenomenon.,S
796,and i i see the harmonics there many time.,S
800,yeah.,B
815,the fraction of the energy that's in the harmonic sequence that you're looking at is relatively low then it should be then it's more likely to be an overlap.,S
825,you're looking at at the phase derivative.,S
827,in in uh,D
862,okay.,S
924,if if it gets in the way of what somebody is doing with it then you might want to have some method which will allow you to block it.,S
934,because it basically has a it shows very clearly the contrast between uh speech recognition research and discourse research.,S
951,uhhuh.,B
957,this the discourse side will have a script which will strip away the things which are non communicative.,S
985,well there's there's,D
990,marking just a little bit and counting on the statistical methods.,S
1002,you were going to say something about,D
1005,you know as the transcribers are going through and if they get a hunk of speech that they're going to transcribe,D
1031,i i wanted to comment a little more just for clarification about this business about the different purposes.,S
1036,a it's not just a minor part.,S
1078,which is that as we've improved our microphone technique we have a lot less breath in the in the more recent uh recordings.,S
1092,i mean i don't think we need to worry a lot about breaths that are happening outside of a you know conversation.,S
60,i mean we don't know that the distribution here is normally,D
108,yeah.,B
111,but it's not not a good measure.,S
169,yeah.,B
314,because if energy doesn't matter there like,D
353,it actually the new student don who um adam has met and he was at one of our meetings,D
358,but in sort of honing in on these different types.,S
411,or a sort of a case where where you would never know that unless you actually go and look at two individuals.,S
423,the flickering is annoying me.,S
440,so,F
441,well it would be lost no matter what you do.,S
454,yeah you're uhhuh tone is going to be very different.,S
506,but i think like all these derivatives and second derivatives and all these other very fancy things,D
613,yeah.,B
631,you know you shouldn't be more than,D
665,okay.,S
669,great.,S
693,yeah.,D
713,it'd be worth a try.,S
725,uhhuh.,B
744,forms.,S
751,oh.,B
817,this would be a radical suggestion but,D
990,but as to whether subjects know where they're from i'm not sure because um i know that they had to fill this out for switchboard.,S
1023,well you have a like techno speak accent i think.,S
1168,characterize your accent if you can.,S
1213,so,F
1214,i mean we we,D
1216,that's true.,S
1287,yeah.,B
1312,and then the the dropping north,D
1351,another suggestion.,S
1369,no.,S
1473,yeah.,B
1512,yeah.,B
1580,okay.,S
1590,uhhuh.,D
51,yeah so i i actually want to to find out about it too.,S
86,oh okay.,S
89,okay so,F
90,so we'll find a time later in the week to uh get together and talk about your understanding of what smartkom plans are.,S
132,facing to to what we've sort of been doing here,D
134,well for one thing we're also using this room to collect data.,S
314,okay so that uh,F
315,yes.,D
419,and i'm not sure if if complex slots of that type are really um being taken into consideration.,S
470,for example the it's the action planner is going to take some spec and make some suggestions about what the user should do.,S
487,yeah.,B
502,and,F
503,uh it's great if people are already taking that into account.,S
512,i think you're going to need,D
527,it ought to be called a a dialogue manager.,S
543,and i think this is just for historical reasons within uh the preparation phase of the project.,S
572,but um so this is um definitely a good point to get uh michael into the discussion.,S
680,are there currently is uh,D
688,you can access this,D
699,so the idea is to uh have a a particular,D
709,and so i have to keep the,D
720,people at d f k i have written a fair number of parsers.,S
732,and they are not fast enough.,S
766,was a learning based approach which learned from a big corpus of of trees.,S
798,then there is of course more ways of parsing things.,S
803,it that seems to me kind of a last resort if uh you can't do it any other way.,S
805,but i don't know.,S
809,and have you looked,D
815,a,D
827,yeah and and purely finite state transducers are not so good for german since there's um,D
835,yeah okay.,S
843,did,D
858,at least for german you have all all of the uh the stemming information.,S
872,i don't remember.,S
914,yeah and here's the case where the english and the german might really be significantly different.,S
942,now actually,D
948,no.,S
1025,the where we are at now is is this,D
1033,the processing of that both on the input end recognizing that certain words in a language talk about containers or goals et cetera.,S
1039,nancy is going to,D
1089,the the construction grammar.,S
8,i don't know.,S
56,uhhuh.,B
63,yeah we have a lot of overlap between this meeting and the morning meeting.,S
69,okay.,S
76,now let let me just give you the other side to that.,S
109,yeah yeah.,S
122,i think that for some time now going back through berp i think that we have had speakers that we've worked with who had non native accents and i i think that,D
146,well i think that um i think that the only thing we should say in the advertisement is that the meeting should be held in english.,S
156,i so i know you know this,D
177,oh.,S
199,okay.,B
208,oh you age-ist!,S
252,yep.,B
254,i i think it's not out of the question.,S
258,so,F
259,yeah.,B
272,i think if we if we want to just record with the tabletop microphones that's easy.,S
363,i thought the free lunch idea was a great idea.,S
388,they they originally they've decided not to do go into speech.,S
397,i'd love to get people that are not linguists or engineers because these are both weird.,S
408,yeah.,B
443,yeah.,B
454,that's a very good point.,S
524,yeah.,B
576,uhhuh.,B
591,so but uh you're figuring you can record another five meetings or something with the space that you're clearing up from the broadcast news.,S
601,yep.,S
641,okay.,F
642,i have uh the result of my work during the last days.,S
724,sorry sorry.,S
773,yeah here i i put uh speech from uh from uh one speaker without uh uh any any any events more.,S
827,is your silence category pure silence or,D
839,i i think what you i think what you mean is that it's non speech segments that don't have impulsive noises.,S
949,i i mean i think the other thing that one i mean this is i think a good thing to do to sort of look at these things at least,D
954,like like c one c two something like that so that you can visualize it.,S
977,yeah.,B
1178,and,D
1250,so when one person is speaking then wherever they happen to be at the point when they're speaking then there's a pretty big maximum right around that point in the in in the lag.,S
1296,and and if there so it and if it's the two of you guys on the same side,D
1304,yeah.,B
1311,great.,S
1343,yeah.,B
1354,oh i saw a demo!,S
1388,network.,S
1401,i think,F
1402,well you could have strips that you stick to your clothing.,S
1404,yeah.,B
1417,so,F
1418,well i had a couple things that i did want to bring out.,S
1430,so we may want to have everyone sign the new form.,S
1438,but it seems like um the anonymization is uh is also something that we might want to discuss in greater length.,S
1467,going and dealing with it.,S
1490,then uh it seems to me that well maybe i uh it seems to me that if you change the name the transcript's going to disagree with the audio and you won't be able to use that.,S
1530,yeah.,B
1639,ugh that's a problem.,S
1693,yeah.,B
1762,uhhuh yeah.,B
1769,i didn't think when i wrote you that email i wasn't thinking it was a big can of worms but i guess it is.,S
1781,and then we wouldn't have to worry about it.,S
1805,um,F
1806,oh do we do digits or,D
1813,okay.,S
1,so,F
6,the both the uh the s r i system and the,D
17,but that's that's using uh a a pretty huge amount of data.,S
21,in fact mostly not digits for the actual training the h m m's whereas uh in this case we're just using digits for training the h m m's.,S
28,probably.,S
34,but,F
35,so there is one difference.,S
48,oh.,S
69,but he's doing it with the same data right?,S
80,uh you know.,F
81,but yeah so far he hadn't gotten any big improvement.,S
87,so yeah we could retrain some of these tandem on on huge,D
95,uhhuh.,B
104,because it's probably not a problem of noise because our features are supposed to be robust to noise.,S
108,i i i'm sorry.,S
116,i uh but i'm i'm almost certain that it it i mean that it has to do with the um amount of training data.,S
120,yeah.,B
124,but but having a huge,D
146,now some of it could be the fact that,D
161,so,F
162,well i guess what i meant is that,D
173,oh.,S
202,so i mean the h t k is an older h t k even.,S
204,uhhuh.,B
211,yeah.,F
212,yeah.,F
213,so the three point four percent for this uh is is,D
215,so why is it,D
219,yeah.,F
220,that's that's my point.,S
257,but,D
269,uhhuh.,B
282,um,F
283,i mean.,F
284,okay.,F
285,that was that topic.,S
293,yeah.,F
294,i i guess the only thing with these the meeting recorder and well,D
303,yeah for sure we will do something for the special session.,S
312,that's fine.,S
317,perhaps the point is that we've been working on is,D
321,so,F
322,yeah.,F
323,i think yeah this is perhaps one of the reason why our system was not not the best.,S
330,uhhuh.,B
342,it's um from o g i.,S
352,yeah.,S
357,yeah but,F
358,but the other thing is uh to use a different v a d entirely.,S
376,yeah.,S
383,yeah.,F
384,uh i designed a new a new filter.,S
401,i think,D
436,so basically we want to look at something like the the excitation signal and,D
448,these are the two.,S
487,pity but i don't have two different,D
531,yeah.,F
532,well this would be this would be perhaps an additional parameter.,S
549,um,F
550,there's uh,D
555,or maybe you could you just do it going through the p f f t's figuring out some um probable um harmonic structure.,S
559,you have read up and you have a paper the paper that you give me yesterday.,S
563,yeah but it's not,D
569,yeah there is this fact actually.,S
591,yeah.,S
601,yeah.,S
604,yeah.,F
605,so what,D
607,what i was talking about was just starting with the f f t.,S
614,it's uh a variant on what you're what you're doing.,S
628,that's what's going on.,S
645,yeah i've just been continue reading um about certain things.,S
648,thinking of maybe using um um modulation spectrum stuff to um as features um also in the in the sub bands.,S
652,yeah.,F
653,just,D
657,and,F
658,um,F
659,so i've been looking at avendano's work.,S
661,uh i'll try to write up in my next status report a nice description of what he's doing.,S
692,so the the way i want to extend his work is make it able to deal with a time varying reverberation response.,S
694,we don't really know how fast the um the reverberation response is varying the meeting recorder data.,S
702,um i think we're sort of done.,S
706,so um,F
707,you do i think you read some of the the zeros as o s and some as zeros.,S
718,ha!,S
723,no.,S
756,yes.,S
764,so it's it's,D
768,actually let me just since since you brought it up i was just it was hard not to be self conscious about that when it after we since we just discussed it.,S
778,o,D
8,uh,F
9,uh we'll see.,S
51,so um i guess we got lots to catch up on.,S
62,so um since we're looking at putting this um mean log magnitude spectral subtraction um into the smartkom system i did a test seeing if um it would work using past only and plus the present to calculate the mean.,S
82,yeah i mean it was pretty it was pretty tiny.,S
85,so that was encouraging.,S
87,that that um that's encouraging for for the idea of using it in an interactive system like smartkom.,S
92,so i before um back in may i did some experiments using say two seconds or four seconds or six seconds.,S
95,here i was curious what if i trained the models using twelve seconds.,S
98,so i did that for about three different conditions.,S
100,i mean i i think it was um four,D
106,usually less than point five percent.,S
157,uh,F
158,by just constraining yourself to have your filter be only a subtraction of the mean you're kind of you know tying your hands behind your back.,S
192,i guess it's something i need to play with more to decide how to set that up for the smartkom system.,S
197,okay.,B
207,well i'm saying in practice yeah.,S
216,or some,D
220,uh in any event they might ask a second question.,S
230,yeah.,S
240,i don't know much about as much as i should about the rest of the system.,S
242,couldn't you uh if you if you sort of did a first pass,D
249,the argument um against multiple passes was has often been but we want to this to be you know have a nice interactive response.,S
255,so um,F
282,the last two weeks was like,D
285,uh,F
286,found that uh single like i just do a normal wiener filtering like the standard method of wiener filtering.,S
297,so that's the improvement is somewhere around like thirty percent over the baseline.,S
322,but that's what i'm confused about.,S
339,errors right i don't have.,S
345,the the the baseline that you are talking about is the m.f.c.c. baseline right?,S
376,four point three.,S
378,ten point seven.,S
401,and again that's the the ten point uh four and twenty point one.,S
434,uh this is the single stage wiener filter.,S
448,so this was uh,D
451,this this was like not improving a lot on this baseline of not having the wiener filter on it.,S
453,so,F
454,uh i ran this stuff with one more stage of wiener filtering on it.,S
461,so i still don't have the word error rate.,S
467,so this was like compared to uh uh fifty seven is what you got by using the french telecom system.,S
474,oh yeah fifty seven,D
504,and what i what i tried was by using the same thing,D
506,so we actually found that the vad is very like crucial.,S
515,so it's like,D
526,so are they going to,D
558,and the overall improvement over the m.f.c.c. baseline,D
565,which is,D
568,which is the overall improvement.,S
583,the other thing also is that fourteen percent is less than what you obtain using a real v.a.d.,S
588,uh,F
589,so i think this shows that there is still work.,S
599,the wiener filter it's it's like it's like you try to minimize,D
618,but that's not the case in uh many many of our cases.,S
635,yeah.,F
636,yeah.,D
642,but the thing is that you have to estimate the s.f. from the noisy spectrum what you have.,S
652,uh,F
653,so that's what that was just the first stage of wiener filtering that i tried.,S
689,stephane is working on spectral subtraction.,S
700,uhhuh.,S
714,cool.,S
717,yeah.,B
731,so the other thing what i tried was i used still the ten frames of noise estimate.,S
737,so,F
744,using the channel zero vad to estimate the noise also seems to be improving.,S
752,no.,S
757,i mean so this is like the noise compensation is fixed.,S
769,yeah but this all these things i have to still try it on the t.i. digits.,S
774,um,F
775,um,F
776,well after that.,S
778,uh,F
779,so the other the other thing is like i've been i'm doing all this stuff on the power spectrum.,S
781,tried this stuff on the mel as well.,S
792,so that's it.,S
798,i was like going parallely.,S
812,so to to remind you a little bit of of what i did before is just to apply some spectral subtraction with an overestimation factor.,S
845,it has the overall power spectrum of speech.,S
865,so this is something i can still work on.,S
882,so in in an ideal word world if the noise were always the same then when you subtracted it the worst that you would get would be a zero.,S
937,uh,F
938,in fact what you'd be doing is saying well we're we're we're going to definitely diminish the effect of this frequency in this little frequency bin in the in the overall mel summation.,S
957,yeah i'm just saying that's like the opposite.,S
962,uhhuh.,B
965,some people also if it's a negative value they uh re compute it using interpolation from the edges and bins.,S
980,huh,F
981,so what i did is uh some kind of nonlinear smoothing.,S
990,what happen actually is that during low s.n.r. values the gain is close to zero.,S
993,and this this is the cause of musical noise and all these the the fact you we go below zero one frame and then you can have an energy that's above zero.,S
997,so the smoothing is i did a smoothing actually on this gain uh trajectory.,S
1003,um,F
1004,yeah.,F
1005,so,F
1006,well.,F
1007,basically that's this idea.,S
1033,uhhuh.,B
1062,right.,B
1066,they use spectral subtraction.,S
1114,does the smoothing in the time domain help,D
1141,yeah.,B
1148,so,F
1149,it could be seen as a a a smoothing in the frequency domain because i used in mel bands in addition and then the other phase of smoothing in the time domain.,S
1151,but when you look at the spectrogram if you don't have any smoothing you clearly see like in silence portions and at the beginning and end of speech you see spots of high energy randomly distributed over the the spectrogram.,S
1164,and,F
1165,well none of these systems by the way have i mean you both are are working with um our system that does not have the neural net.,S
1175,yeah.,S
1184,if we have no uh spectral subtraction or wiener filtering um the system is uh we thought the neural neural network is much better than before.,S
1188,maybe.,S
1211,people done lots of experimentation over the years with training neural nets.,S
1230,huh.,B
1233,but to some extent that's kind of what we're doing.,S
1246,so,F
1247,um,F
1248,yeah i mean we'll just have to try it.,S
1258,yeah so this is the um,D
1265,uh the first thing i tried to optimize is the um time constant of the smoothing.,S
1268,it's amazing how often that happens.,S
1270,so this is the first thing.,S
1272,yeah another thing that i it's important to mention is um that this has this has some additional latency.,S
1274,because when i do the smoothing uh it's a recursion that estimated the means so of the of the gain curve.,S
1276,this is a filter that has some latency.,S
1291,and the latency of this recursion is around fifty milliseconds.,S
1299,yeah.,S
1301,i'm sorry.,S
1326,um,F
1327,huh.,B
1329,so uh,F
1330,it's depending on how all this stuff comes out.,S
1338,yeah.,S
1341,um,F
1342,so,D
1349,you know maybe you could make it twenty five.,S
1358,um,F
1359,so,F
1360,yeah there are other things in the um algorithm that i didn't uh a lot yet.,S
1370,it's it's added.,S
1386,so sometimes you can do it anyway.,S
1389,i,D
1415,but the only thing is that the first frame in that twenty four frame buffer has a twenty four frame latency.,S
1420,yeah i wasn't thinking of that one in particular.,S
1430,so,F
1431,um,F
1432,there is uh these parameters that i still have to to look at.,S
1435,but i still have to to look more at this.,S
1437,at the level of noise i add after uh i know that adding noise helped um the system just using spectral subtraction without smoothing.,S
1444,um yep.,S
1456,but so what's this result you told me about the fact that if you use more than ten frames you can improve by,D
1473,yeah.,S
1476,but in this experiment i did i didn't use any v.a.d.,S
1480,okay that's it for spectral subtraction.,S
1483,and for this i simply used some code that uh i had from from belgium.,S
1486,and for each frequency bands of this frame takes a look at the minima of the energy.,S
1515,actually it's better to use sixty four milliseconds because um if you use thirty milliseconds then uh because of the this short windowing and at low pitch uh sounds the harmonics are not uh correctly separated.,S
1530,so the interest of this is that as with this technique you can estimate some reasonable noise spectra with only five hundred milliseconds of of signal.,S
1538,so what i did is just to simply replace the v.a.d. based uh noise estimate by this estimate.,S
1544,i think the reason why it's not better is that the speechdat-car noises are all stationary.,S
1546,so,F
1547,there really is no need to have something that's adaptive.,S
1550,well they are mainly stationary.,S
1552,but i expect maybe some improvement on t.i. digits.,S
1556,but are you comparing with something,D
1574,okay.,S
1595,yeah for for sure i will.,S
1605,i don't estimate the noise on the ten frames but use his estimate.,S
1609,yeah.,F
1610,i um also implemented a um spectral whitening idea.,S
1617,yeah.,F
1618,with this no improvement.,S
1621,um,F
1622,actually this this could be seen as a soft version of the frame dropping.,S
1632,so i think maybe it can be used together with frame dropping and when we are not sure about if it's speech or silence.,S
1648,because that that brings in sort of powers of classifiers that we don't really have in uh this other estimate.,S
1664,yeah so there are with this technique there are some,D
1673,uhhuh.,B
1675,uh,F
1676,so yeah.,F
1677,the next thing i started to do is to uh try to develop a better voice activity detector.,S
1679,um,F
1680,i,D
1682,yeah for this i think we can maybe try to train the neural network for voice activity detection on all the data that we have including all the speechdat-car data.,S
1684,and so i'm starting to obtain alignments on these databases.,S
1688,it seems to be,D
1690,actually what i observed is that for italian it doesn't seem there seems to be a problem.,S
1693,so it doesn't seems to help by their use of channel zero or channel one.,S
1703,the the current v.a.d. that we have was trained on uh spine right?,S
1710,actually we observed we listened to some of the utterances and sometimes for finnish there is music in the recordings and strange things.,S
1714,yeah so the idea was to train all the databases and obtain an alignment to train on these databases.,S
1716,also to um try different kind of features uh as input to the v.a.d. network.,S
1718,we came up with a bunch of features that we want to try.,S
1723,the energy also.,S
1730,well hans-guenter will be here next week.,S
1733,uhhuh.,B
5,okay.,S
19,i seem to be having difficulty getting this adjusted.,S
24,so far no one has made any ach any comments on them.,S
27,so,F
28,i don't expect anyone to.,S
30,so what follows,D
62,that's right.,S
75,we probably should have talked about it.,S
98,and so no reply is no changes.,S
112,so,F
113,yeah the reason i did that it was just so that people would not censor not ask to have stuff removed because it was transcribed incorrectly.,S
120,so you have it nicely set up so they email you.,S
124,so,F
125,and i wanted to say the meetings that are involved in that set are robustness and meeting recorder.,S
190,i i i i think that somebody might request something.,S
222,i i think that there's one missing line.,S
251,maybe we should say in,D
265,and the and the form was approved by human subjects.,S
274,oh okay.,S
361,that's right.,S
364,you'll either wonder at the beginning or you'll wonder at the end.,S
373,it's much easier to explain this way.,S
424,you know like dead beat dads.,S
467,how how much implication would there be that it's likely you're going to be changing something as opposed to,D
477,i think that if you if we send the email as you have.,S
516,okay.,S
568,well the the question is just whether how active it has to be.,S
597,and and and you know people people see long emails about things that they don't think is going to be high priority they typically uh don't don't read it or half read it.,S
601,and actually,D
617,if you were going to if you're predicting that you might not answer you have a chance now to say that.,S
629,so that way they could they can see from that email that if they just write back and say i got it no changes they're off the hook.,S
633,i mean the other thing i've learned from dealing with dealing with people sending in reviews and so forth uh is um if you say you've got three months to do this review um people do it you know two and seven eighths months from now.,S
638,if we make it a little less time i don't think it'll be that much,D
672,but i guess it's a pain.,S
720,hide it.,S
754,yeah.,S
769,move them to the bottom.,S
795,you you can,D
830,yeah.,S
838,yeah reply.,S
934,huh.,B
971,well we can talk about it off line.,S
989,and now the first one.,S
993,really um it was we learned too much.,S
1030,sometimes some speakers will insert foreign language terms.,S
1058,instead of from something or other cards it's for multicast.,S
1092,you know until you actually get a decent language model adam's right.,S
1123,i don't know exactly.,S
1137,because i uh i could use one on my workstation.,S
1142,we have actually i have,D
1188,definitely.,S
1201,oh i thought you meant the disk space.,S
1213,yeah it's great.,S
1223,without thinking about it when i offered up my hard drive last week,D
1232,we've just ordered a hundred gigabytes.,S
1243,so,F
1268,i think if i'm,D
1273,and um in the meantime i'll just hold out.,S
1281,all right great.,S
1319,so,F
1320,so anyway i'll be putting together stuff.,S
1330,but you know i'm i'm sure before it's all done i'll end up bugging people for for more clarification about stuff.,S
1332,i don't know.,S
1336,yeah so that wasn't a long one just to tell you that and if something hasn't uh,D
1342,i guess uh you're still pecking away at the demos and all that probably.,S
1347,okay.,S
1350,not here but later today.,S
1358,oh okay.,S
1368,if you want to do a quick,D
1375,and there's the digits to do.,S
1389,yeah well i'm going to be on the phone tomorrow.,S
1443,yeah.,B
1468,but we're hoping to have a paper for that as well.,S
1499,i'll pick up your dry cleaning too.,S
3,so basically the result of much thinking since the last time we met um but not as much writing um is a sheet that i have a lot of like thoughts and justification of comments on.,S
6,here.,S
49,um just to show it doesn't have to be beautiful latex.,S
88,sort of skipping fonts and whatever.,S
104,so i don't know if the syntax will hold but something that gives you a way to do both constructional and meaning types.,S
106,okay then i don't think the um,D
161,and so i was like okay well both of you don't like it.,S
211,so i think the middle block doesn't really give you any more information than the top block.,S
227,there is a slight complication here which is that when we talk about form it's useful sometimes to talk about um to talk about there also being a designated object.,S
265,well right now it's a uh construction type and meaning type.,S
285,i i don't know if we'll ever have a case where we actually,D
317,that i i have no problem with it at all.,S
329,i mean this is not reverting to the x. bar theory of of phrase structure.,S
332,right.,S
337,but they does.,S
357,moving it to another place right.,S
363,yeah.,S
392,yeah.,S
425,okay so that's great.,S
494,you know you could imagine for both of those are absolute things you could say about the time and place.,S
531,correct.,S
586,huh.,B
634,well i'll check.,S
637,i think the the designate that we have in terms of meaning is really the highlight this thing with respect to everything else okay?,S
662,in was a good example.,S
686,right yeah this is going to be a,D
693,i i would,D
725,uh and distinguish that from it's effect.,S
754,it's it is kind of like a profile profile background thing.,S
766,okay anyway so that's there are there are many more things that are that are sort of like a little bit unstable about the notation.,S
774,yeah.,B
790,okay.,S
852,you know,F
853,it's,D
940,okay.,S
942,okay that was one comment.,S
978,one thing that i didn't do consistently um is when we get there is like indicate what kind of thing fits into every role.,S
1032,um and then the status i used was like again in some languages you know like for instance in child language you might distinguish between different status.,S
1046,uh there's there's all this stuff about discourse status we've talked about.,S
1053,the thing is that that i noticed that that um list was sort of discourse dependent.,S
1060,yeah they're and for instance i used to have a location thing there.,S
1090,right this guy i know from school came for dinner does not mean um there's a guy i know him from school.,S
1107,you know so so you could imagine that this might not,D
1129,so again,D
1154,i think this came up when uh ben and i were working with the spaniards um the other day.,S
1163,yeah.,S
1192,now for the moment we just need the ability to write it down if if somebody figured out what the rules were.,S
1197,some of these other ones,D
1200,uh one thing i'm uncertain about is how polarity interacts.,S
1216,i mean how you get it may may will often involve the discourse.,S
1296,even though saying that place takes place whatever.,S
1304,yeah so cause and,D
1387,so i would prefer not to worry about that for right now.,S
1432,mats gould.,S
1437,i don't know where he is right now.,S
1518,uhhuh.,B
1548,there's you know whatever it it could point at one of these.,S
1610,but uh that happens to sound like the word for i.,S
1634,i mean the point is that pronoun references uh you know sort of ties in with all this mental space stuff and so on and so forth.,S
1653,it's like it's like what's happening that yeah what's happening uh there is that you're moving the base space or something like that right?,S
1659,uhhuh.,B
1678,but the uh but it's too bad that we don't have a camera.,S
1685,yeah.,B
1712,and it was like it's not using any kind of interesting embedded ways.,S
1716,yeah but about linguistic hedges.,S
1730,well we were just talking about this sort of evidentiality and stuff like that right?,S
1746,uh great word in the english language is called about.,S
1776,we just won't deal with sarcastic people.,S
1800,i i don't know the answer.,S
1820,mockery.,S
1824,uh no end of things that that you know we don't deal with.,S
1827,go ahead.,S
1845,yeah right i mean,D
1878,okay.,B
1913,basically.,S
1944,oops.,S
1946,no.,S
1951,like constructions can inherit from other things.,S
1960,um yeah there should be i i wanted to find out someday if there was going to be some way of dealing with uh if this is the right term multiple inheritance.,S
1980,and we've been talking a little bit about that anyway.,S
1984,okay.,S
1990,but whatever.,S
2040,yeah.,B
2042,for the time being it's it's it's fine to do it,D
2047,uh all the things you want to query you just have to like ask for separately.,S
2053,i don't know.,S
2129,but uh,D
2143,tricky.,S
2149,oh you have something.,S
2161,i would suggest as soon as possible.,S
2168,we can do it thursday again.,S
2189,no.,S
3,but i think we ought to just get started.,S
10,so there you go.,S
22,oh right well,D
41,oh are you going to go there or not.,S
48,and i'm sure we'll find more as we go that,D
60,so there is this question about,D
114,but okay.,F
137,yeah.,B
182,let's forget it.,S
192,well i mean in srini's thing there was this thing there was this um option like proper inferences which suggests that uh doesn't happen automatically.,S
205,oh just uh accidentally erased this.,S
211,so we're,D
214,it's clear where where we are right now.,S
222,oops!,S
235,although that,D
259,well some of those are subsumed by approach.,S
272,that's subtle but true.,S
274,so let's just leave it three with three for now.,S
285,and then of course we had the fact that given the fact that he's thrifty and there will be admission then we get all these cross um,D
309,and then what you and i have to talk about is okay if we're doing that and they get combined somehow uh how do they get combined.,S
345,but that's that seems to,D
372,seems to me that we've sort of embedded a lot embedded a lot of these uh things we had in there previously in in in some of the other final decisions done here.,S
394,so let me suggest this.,S
420,uh uh well it it here's where it gets a little tricky.,S
455,and where was the accessible yeah.,S
457,accessible i think is different.,S
483,i mean it seems like that's much more reliable.,S
488,now we may wind up having to do that.,S
515,anyway so let me suggest you do something else.,S
531,okay well not a big deal then.,S
561,right.,B
575,yeah.,S
594,so and and we assume that some of these properties would come indirectly through an ontology.,S
611,um that's from the user model.,S
617,somebody else has built this user model.,S
630,so uh you and so here let me give you two ways to handle that.,S
642,so that uh,D
645,yeah that's all.,S
670,right.,S
693,and the other is it it gets used.,S
729,i guess the the question uh is,D
775,so let me suggest we switch to another one.,S
783,and then everything would be clean.,S
791,so this might be,D
800,what makes things more likely that,D
808,i i don't yet know how to do this.,S
829,this be specific for second year.,S
831,and and we probably will have uh something like a discourse for endpoint.,S
843,well i think um we're looking at the the little data that we have.,S
881,right so that's that's where it starts getting to be uh uh essentially more interesting.,S
893,yeah that's what i said.,S
925,maybe we could um have intermediate node that just the endpoint and the go there s node sort of fed into.,S
944,yes.,S
953,uh but this isn't this is this line is just coming from over here.,S
971,if there's parking maybe,D
979,and discourse is something that sort of,D
990,and then also the discourse endpoint.,S
993,uhhuh.,B
999,huh,F
1000,okay.,S
1014,hey there's a strike on uh does that affect whether or not you want to go or something.,S
1017,yeah so that might not come out of a user model.,S
1039,because i want to do a little bit of organization.,S
1075,uhhuh.,B
1122,i mean it can get big fast.,S
1148,read it,D
1155,well it's all fine to say all these arrows come into the same place.,S
1206,i don't yeah i just don't think this has been designed to support something like that.,S
1265,is that uh,D
1272,so basically um what we don't want to do is to for every single combination of e and v and a and every single letter e give a number.,S
1296,yeah.,B
1317,so we've assumed equal weights.,S
1353,all right.,S
1362,you have a new thing called h.,S
1494,i would be surprised if it supports anything more than what we have right here.,S
1496,yeah.,B
1514,the figure i was thinking about this figure that we talked about.,S
1529,well it will inspire me.,S
24,that's the huh actual reason.,S
31,what a great time to be coming back to the u.s. of a..,S
43,yeah.,S
45,that's that bit of news.,S
74,you remember in the the hand thing in one eighty two like not only was it able to recognize but it was also to generate based upon situations.,S
99,so there's no no end of potential things one could get out of it if that works.,S
102,well then he probably should be coming back a year from now.,S
121,i think it'd be fun to look at it or into that question.,S
212,well i'm talking about,D
245,i don't really know.,S
250,if it takes us a second to do for each one and let's say it's twenty billion then that's twenty billion seconds.,S
273,so this is just an idea that's floating around.,S
280,oh questions.,S
282,i'll ask eva about the e. bayes and she's working on that.,S
311,okay.,S
326,the paper.,S
336,okay.,S
344,yeah.,B
348,yep.,S
356,or,F
357,here's an idea right.,S
380,the the question is what could we actually do and and and keep a straight face while doing it.,S
441,we're talking about this um alleged paper that we may just sort of,D
479,uh both learning and like comprehension production that kind of stuff.,S
499,well i i also think that if we sort of write about what we have done in the past six months we we we could sort of craft a nice little paper that if it gets rejected which could happen doesn't hurt.,S
541,maybe even that's maybe the time to introduce the the new formalism that you guys have cooked up.,S
571,that would be hard.,S
606,look at the web page and let's talk about it maybe tomorrow afternoon.,S
653,don't make any plans for spring break next year.,S
696,i mean we're going to have an example case.,S
721,okay go on.,S
764,give them the one paragraph whirlwind tour of what this is for.,S
767,uhhuh.,D
782,you may may ruin your career forever if you appear.,S
785,the uh other thing,D
799,a few more bits.,S
807,okay.,S
818,the sudo-square is situation user discourse right ontology.,S
860,stop excluding me.,S
868,cool keith.,S
894,because things fit onto that see?,S
927,we have discussed in terms of the eva,D
940,we don't want a hard code a set of lexemes or things that person's you know sort of filter or uh search the discourse history.,S
964,the the idea is even more general.,S
978,no go ahead.,S
1031,but okay nevertheless so these are issues.,S
1062,uh uh.,D
1087,yeah we we wouldn't.,S
1101,and then given that we know that the construction has these two things we can set up probabilities.,S
1105,let's assume we we call something like a loc x. node and a path x. node.,S
1137,so is the question,D
1164,it will be the same.,S
1189,so,D
1206,let's see.,S
1274,okay.,S
1277,do so would you want to say that those two are both like,D
1301,think uh well this is just a mental exercise.,S
1340,here's hoping.,S
1357,in the literature there's bank.,S
1370,and the the the only,D
1404,and that's also maybe interesting for keith and whoever if you want to get some more stuff into the data collection.,S
1418,so that's cool.,S
1426,i guess it has to be transcribed huh?,S
1437,i can,D
1439,i mean you know that i that i looked at the first the first one and got enough data to keep me going for you know probably most of july.,S
1441,yeah probably not the right way to do it actually.,S
4,i guess,D
6,so,F
12,so one thing is to talk about a kick off meeting.,S
15,and then just uh i guess uh progress reports individually and then uh plans for where we go between now and then pretty much.,S
17,i could say a few words about um some of the uh compute stuff that's happening around here.,S
25,yeah.,B
28,uh we ordered uh sun blade one hundreds.,S
30,i'm not sure exactly how long it'll take for those to come in.,S
40,there's a,D
46,uh there's a command uh that you can use called run command.,S
53,you can try this as a simple test with uh the l.s. command.,S
67,you can control where your jobs go to a certain extent.,S
74,there's a lot of nice features to it.,S
77,right now andreas and i have been the main ones using it.,S
81,so as i understand you know he's using all the machines and you're using all the machines.,S
87,uh i fired off a training job.,S
93,soon as we get some more machines then uh then we'll have more compute available.,S
95,um,F
96,that's just a quick update about what we've got.,S
99,uhhuh.,S
112,so um,F
113,you know you should you should probably not run more than say ten jobs yourself at any one time.,S
122,so you should try to limit it to some number around ten jobs at a time.,S
124,so if you had a script for example that had a thousand things it needed to run um you'd somehow need to put some logic in there if you were going to use run command uh to only have ten of those going at a time.,S
127,i remember i i forget whether it was when the rutgers or or hopkins workshop.,S
142,huh.,B
144,um,F
145,but uh you can also,D
158,i can get some documentation.,S
164,if you run command that i mentioned before is doesn't know about other things that you might be running.,S
181,like for example uh if you didn't want to write a p. make script.,S
207,um what what about,D
218,okay.,S
234,yeah.,S
236,so um,F
237,yeah.,F
238,yeah.,F
239,i i can i'm not sure about that one.,S
242,okay.,S
247,i think maybe i'll ask you after the meeting.,S
249,yeah.,S
260,well why don't we uh,D
265,yeah.,F
266,so,F
267,uh shall i start from,D
273,after the submission the what i've been working on mainly was to take take other submissions.,S
278,so i tried,D
280,and first i tried just l.d.a.,S
283,i mean if if i combine it with l.d.a. it gives improvement over theirs.,S
291,just just the l.d.a. filters.,S
299,that seems to be giving uh improving over their uh system.,S
305,so then after after that i i added uh online normalization also on top of that.,S
310,i didn't i didn't play with that time constant a lot.,S
317,yeah.,F
318,and uh,F
319,uh the other other thing what i tried was i just um uh took the baseline and then ran it with the endpoint uh information.,S
324,i found that the baseline itself improves by twenty two percent by just giving the,D
328,i guess my mind wandered.,S
351,okay.,B
353,oh yeah.,S
373,i mean clearly they're interact.,S
394,so it should make the spectral subtraction style things work even better.,S
407,so the baseline itself improves by fifty percent.,S
415,so,F
416,so that is when uh the the qualification criteria was reduced from fifty percent to something like twenty five percent for well matched.,S
419,yeah.,S
423,no that's that's that's a good good update.,S
433,so i've been actually running some,D
440,so you you so you said one thing i want to jump on for a second.,S
448,so maybe uh just briefly you could remind us about the related experiments.,S
457,uhhuh.,F
458,it was system one.,S
460,okay.,S
469,i mean which are extracted at the handset.,S
477,sorry.,S
499,but you got some sort of different result.,S
502,yeah well i think we should uh have a table with all the result.,S
506,okay.,S
513,uhhuh.,B
522,uhhuh.,S
525,um,F
526,when we plug the spectral subtraction it improves uh significantly.,S
528,but what seems clear also is that we have to retune the time constants of the online normalization.,S
537,yeah.,B
539,yeah i assume.,S
573,well there are some minor changes.,S
579,but,D
585,even if it's only slightly worse for well matched.,S
589,but well.,F
590,i don't think it's important.,S
593,uh mainly because of uh when you you plug the um frame dropping in the baseline system it will improve a lot h.m. and m.m.,S
596,um i guess what will happen,D
601,but the the well matched may still,D
606,so the,D
612,yeah.,F
613,yeah.,F
614,yeah.,B
629,it seems to me that the well matched condition is going to be unusual.,S
636,huh.,B
638,huh.,B
647,uh,F
648,i mean the the well matched condition is not like uh the one in t.i. digits.,S
673,right.,S
675,yeah unless they deliberately chose it to be different which they didn't because they want it to be well matched.,S
697,so i,D
699,i guess they're saying that if you were a company that was selling the stuff commercially that you would have a bunch of people driving around in a bunch of cars.,S
704,yeah yeah yeah.,B
706,so,F
712,it would be a very simple spectral subtraction on the um mel energies.,S
731,huh.,S
735,huh.,B
738,but for speech recognition it may not.,S
743,yeah.,F
744,huh.,B
771,well the other thing would be to combine what you're doing.,S
802,it is like a k.l. transform followed by a wiener filter.,S
825,so,F
826,so,F
827,so that that's one reason maybe we could combine.,S
836,the colored noise the the the signal subspace approach has i mean it it actually depends on inverting the matrices.,S
868,uh yeah.,F
869,so there is this.,S
871,maybe we,D
876,if you take the standard model of channel plus noise uh it's it's a nonlinear uh transformation in the cepstral domain.,S
880,uh there is a way to approximate this using uh first order or second order taylor series.,S
882,it can be used for uh getting rid of the noise and the channel effect.,S
905,uhhuh.,S
907,yeah so at any rate you're looking general uh standing back from it looking at ways to combine one form or another of uh noise removal uh with with these other things we have.,S
912,but for sure there's required to that requires to re check everything else and re-optimize the other things.,S
915,for sure the online normalization may be the l.d.a. filter.,S
917,well one of the seems like one of the things to go through next week when hari's here.,S
927,you know.,F
928,so i mean one way would,D
938,uh,F
939,but um,F
940,uh he'll have some ideas on that too.,S
948,spectral subtraction doesn't seems to be the thing to do for large vocabulary tasks.,S
959,i i guess guenter hirsch is in charge of that.,S
962,maybe roger.,S
972,i'm not sure about that.,S
976,well we've,D
983,it had additive,D
991,okay.,B
993,now we have this um meeting data.,S
999,that we have uh for the uh the quote unquote noisy data there is just noisy and reverberant actually.,S
1007,but uh we have recognition now with some of the continuous speech.,S
1012,no training from this.,S
1028,i mean i guess no one had done yet done test one on the distant mike using uh the s.r.i. recognizer.,S
1030,i don't,D
1038,uh yeah.,F
1039,but you're right.,S
1044,but um,F
1045,good.,S
1063,the the cepstrum coefficient.,S
1074,the first you have the the spectrum of the signal.,S
1103,i do i did two type of experiment to include this feature directly with the with the other feature.,S
1121,uh is it with t.i. digits or with,D
1135,but you'll do throw something away.,S
1138,so,F
1139,when they were looking at the difference between the filter bank and the f.f.t. that was going into the filter bank i was thinking oh okay.,S
1175,i saw within very short distance of one another a couple different posters that showed about the wonders of some auditory inspired front end or something.,S
1183,um,F
1184,uh,F
1185,it's same you know argument that's gone both ways about uh you know we have these data driven filters in l.d.a.,S
1190,yeah,F
1191,part of what we're discovering is ways to combine things that are data driven than are not.,S
1200,you know maybe there's something to be gained from it.,S
1207,it's just a thought.,S
1232,uhhuh.,B
1244,yeah yeah.,S
1246,huh.,B
1248,um,F
1249,huh.,B
1267,cumulants.,S
1274,or,D
1277,i mean he was showing up uh some something on noisy speech.,S
1294,i mean it doesn't do it very specifically.,S
1299,yep.,B
1303,um nothing i want to really talk about.,S
1308,so,F
1309,um i told you i was i was i was getting prepared to take this qualifier exam.,S
1314,um the idea is you have all these these different events.,S
1324,and um these these primary detectors um will be uh inspired by you know multi band techniques um doing things um similar to larry saul's work on uh graphical models to to detect these these uh acoustic events.,S
1333,so,F
1334,um i kind of see like after after building the primary detectors i see um myself taking the outputs and feeding them in sort of tandem style into into a um gaussian mixtures h.m.m. back end um and doing recognition.,S
1336,so that's that's just generally what i've been looking at.,S
1339,by by the way uh the voiced-unvoiced version of that for instance could tie right in to what carmen was looking at.,S
1342,uhhuh.,B
1358,and so this this past week um i've been uh looking a little bit into uh traps um and doing doing traps on on these events too.,S
1361,and,F
1362,um other than that uh i was kicked out of i. house for living there for four years.,S
1371,yeah.,F
1372,and uh,F
1373,yep.,S
1382,and she would get back to me on monday.,S
1402,well if there's a house available or place to.,S
1412,you know if you're in a desperate situation and you need a place to stay you could stay with me for a while.,S
1429,yeah.,D
1436,it's,D
1441,so he he created a lot of synthetic audio files of vowel to vowel transitions.,S
1446,so i gave him a p.l.p. spectrum.,S
1473,but what we'd used to do when i did synthesis at national semiconductor twenty years ago the technique we were playing with initially was was taking the l.p.c. polynomial and and uh finding the roots.,S
1494,so um,F
1495,if every root that's,D
1501,so for each,D
1505,for the i'm using an eighth order polynomial.,S
1530,actually you have peaks that are not at the formant's positions.,S
1539,wasn't a formant synthesizer was it?,S
1545,one thing that the um l.p.c. approach will hopefully give me in addition um is that i i might be able to find the the bandwidths of these humps as well.,S
1549,but i don't think there's a a really good reason not to um get the formant frequencies from the synthesizer instead.,S
1556,uhhuh.,D
1573,um,F
1574,but,F
1575,yeah.,F
1576,okay.,F
1577,so uh,F
1578,yeah you're going back today.,S
21,well i sort of had informal talks with most of you.,S
29,the uh java the embedded bayes wants to take input uh uh a bayes-net in in some java notation.,S
57,just going to be you know,D
87,if it's okay that we give her a couple of more hours per week then she'll do that.,S
105,you know.,S
109,but anyway send me the note.,S
115,if she's really going to do that then we should be able to get prosody as well.,S
134,you know the usual party voices.,S
149,oregon.,S
164,leave it.,S
167,and it's probably also absolutely uninteresting for all of you to um learn that as of twenty minutes ago david and i per accident uh managed to get the whole smartkom system running on the uh icsi linux machines with the icsi n.t. machines.,S
221,um,F
222,but the meeting looks like it's it's going to be good.,S
224,yeah.,B
235,so but anyway,F
236,yeah.,S
244,that's uh looks pretty good.,S
246,yeah i'll say it now.,S
248,and it looks to me like we're now at a good point to do something start working on something really hard.,S
269,one of the things i would like to do over the next uh month it may take more is to understand to what extent we can not only figure out the constructions for them for multiple worlds,D
271,uh sort of what the formalism will look like and where the slots and fillers will be but also what that would translate into in terms of belief net and the inferences.,S
285,you know in the long run we need to solve both of those.,S
290,and sometimes it's actually easier to solve two hard problems than one.,S
295,we'll see.,S
302,and it would take a really long time to explain it now.,S
306,that's great.,S
324,oh another thing,D
326,there was this uh thing that nancy agreed to in a in a weak moment this morning that.,S
356,okay.,B
358,uh communication.,S
409,it's gone.,S
411,the question of whether the polysemy is sort of like in the construction or pragmatic.,S
423,the question is whether the construction is semantic or like ambiguous between asking for location and asking for path.,S
427,should we have a a a,D
473,well the question is basically is this conventional or conversational implicature.,S
501,back to the old johno observation that if if you have a dialogue history and it said the word admission fee was uh mentioned um it's more likely that the person actually wants to enter than just take a picture of it.,S
534,well uh is it doesn't it seem like if you just managed the dialogue history with a a thread that you know kept track of of the activity of,D
540,but here's here's a way,D
550,it would already be higher in the context.,S
574,that the uh standard way that that these contexts work is sort of stack like or whatever.,S
597,so one could well imagine,D
633,so if the issue is if so now this construction has been matched and you say okay does this actually have any implications for our decisions then there's another piece of code that presumably does that computation.,S
640,maybe.,S
679,i think it's also something that people have not done before is um sort of abuse an ontology for these kinds of uh inferences on,D
682,i have the uh if we wanted to have that function in the dialogue dialogue module of smartkom i have the written consent of jan to put it in there.,S
713,um,F
714,yeah so i think in fact that's the other thing.,S
741,yeah.,B
762,anyhow.,S
766,so we'll we'll find a way.,S
771,i haven't okay.,S
776,always good.,S
812,good luck really.,S
820,meeting regular meeting time for the summer.,S
828,and the n.t.l. meeting moved to wednesday.,S
872,yeah that's me too.,S
876,well if one sort of thing is this room is taken at after three thirty pretty much every day.,S
892,okay.,B
905,interesting.,D
916,and the,D
937,the multiple meetings.,S
942,right.,S
953,um all of the proposed times sound fine with me.,S
982,sorry two p.m.,S
1009,i might i might um,D
1020,okay and we'll you want to,D
1049,okay.,S
1051,sounds good.,D
1070,it's more general.,S
1095,yeah.,S
1112,yeah.,B
1137,and you know this is sort of a nice way to do it.,S
1146,skolemization.,S
1166,anyway but just that kind of thing.,S
1169,good.,S
1177,yeah well if if i mean part of of what the exercise is by the end of next week is to say what are the things that we just don't have answers for yet.,S
1193,okay.,S
1208,like in the meeting i mean he sort of i like the last meeting we had i think we were all very much part of it.,S
1211,sometimes hans has been sort of coming in there as sort of like a devil's advocate type role or something.,S
1232,okay this is consistent with um the role i had suggested that he he play.,S
1256,no right i mean that role is is uh indispensable.,S
1281,that's you know i think very close to the maximum number of people working together that can get something done.,S
1334,and i think it's a it's a perfectly fine place to start.,S
1338,well it definitely makes the problem easier.,S
1,so i uh uh wanted to mention a couple little bits of news.,S
10,uh that's my news.,S
24,but i don't know maybe june.,S
27,anyway hynek will be here next week and maybe he'll know more about it.,S
29,well the news more specifically for aurora.,S
31,so i guess there was again a conference call but uh they are not decide on everything yet.,S
48,so they would just provide that as part of the data.,S
59,nothing much.,S
61,probably the um these weight things they will apply the same kind of weighting scheme for t i digits than for the speechdat car.,S
64,it would be an average of improvements rather than an average of word error rates which would make the more clean parts of t i digits more important than they are right now.,S
70,they they i think they will tend to go this way but huh.,S
72,if we have the result for the tandem with um m s g also,D
89,oh yes.,S
99,uh,F
107,yeah.,S
122,but i don't know what's the status of this.,S
133,um.,F
134,yeah.,F
135,huh.,B
138,well,F
139,huh.,B
146,yeah.,F
147,so i guess yeah we,D
173,if if the um channel and the reverberation is multiplicative in the frequency domain with the speech spectrum then the phases should be additive.,S
189,i don't know.,S
202,at least while we're you know working on uh all different of kinds of variations and that would let us you know pump through a lot more experiments.,S
206,oh!,S
210,uhhuh.,B
219,i was thinking it was gaussians but it's states.,S
221,okay.,B
231,let's see.,F
232,um why don't why don't we uh if there aren't any other major things why don't we do the digits and then then uh turn the mikes off.,S
17,and chuck gets stuck with the ear plug mike.,S
29,i was asking if we could to uh kind of make it just whatever is happening rather than one or the other.,S
42,so uh you didn't you didn't get an agenda.,S
48,our normal transcription status.,S
81,that's it.,S
131,you know this this raises some,D
138,huh,F
139,i mean it seems like probably we have enough now.,S
157,yeah i mean uh,D
166,you know it's just basically.,S
168,you know i i don't have to time to to do too much these days.,S
171,uhhuh.,B
176,uh i thought you you were already using adaptation on the test set.,S
205,for this particular kind of application.,S
219,um,F
220,yeah as long as you're aware that you're doing that that's i don't see that as a problem.,S
261,yeah.,B
276,yeah it's possible they'll open it up to more people.,S
283,um so then if they start a bunch of recordings then ultimately they'll they'll have training sets and test sets.,S
286,but,D
309,um so i would see us as probably not doing more recordings.,S
317,i guess we have an unknown rate.,S
320,uh although it would have been nice if that their stuff had come earlier.,S
324,um well i got a email from one of the u w guys.,S
327,i didn't ask why.,S
439,you know part of the arguments for the higher sampling rate is that maybe there's something you know say in six to ten kilohertz that you might use for for some purposes somewhere.,S
450,so uh i i i think it's it's uh,D
474,they're they're in a different situation because they're doing video.,S
505,you're going to have to just get,D
639,good.,S
650,so if you put it there people will use it.,S
652,so i think after that we need another uh rack or something.,S
675,but he wants to go to new servers not just for us.,S
681,i guess i need to talk to him more about,D
740,i'm probably mispronouncing it well.,S
759,it combines the categories of you know currently in,D
770,i could write on the board.,S
781,we need different color pens definitely.,S
798,but about how much do we have that's sort of uh,D
801,the total meeting time is seventy five hours.,S
804,oh.,D
877,oh.,S
891,yeah we have new hardware.,S
959,but feel free to overlap.,S
999,that's a,D
1009,well i mean what happened was that transcriber's very slow to load.,S
1043,but it has to be multi stream.,S
1055,so,F
1056,and and that's actually a good model which is what this current tool that we're using has is to to associate these labels with um attributes of s g m l tags.,S
1081,so,F
1082,are you using,D
1095,and then uh,D
1107,actually i wanted to say off line with you about any literature reviews i should do beforehand.,S
1126,okay.,S
1160,um fishing went pretty well.,S
1169,so your so your results are about the same as bush's.,S
1177,yeah right exactly.,S
1184,but right now i guess uh i'm working on this paper this isca paper for this workshop that liz and andreas and i are putting together.,S
1192,hopefully by the twentieth the twenty third.,S
1215,so while he's vacationing um we've been uh,D
1222,you know apart from getting preparing the the the data for the,D
1232,yeah.,B
1256,um on the recognition side actually um i think the main person doing that is uh harriet from harriet nock from uh formerly of cambridge.,S
1263,it could be that our recognizer's actually doing relatively well.,S
1267,oh!,S
1273,yeah other than that uh,D
1325,yeah.,B
1348,right.,B
1354,but there's uh you know wiener filtering and spectral subtraction.,S
1357,and they've now built up a nice piece of software that does,D
1359,has this sort of general framework for a for it.,S
1362,uhhuh.,B
1366,okay.,B
1389,well we're mostly looking for places where the person's frustrated with the system.,S
1406,yeah.,B
1409,there's not a lot of enough frustration for us to really go through quickly.,S
1426,we we talked about something a ways back and i sort of lost track of it.,S
1438,okay yeah because this will be like after,D
1465,yeah.,B
1468,okay.,S
1479,hopefully soon we can look at some of the labelled stuff.,S
1503,so,F
1504,maybe maybe this is too obvious to be right.,S
1586,get a bunch of histograms.,S
34,you like these.,S
38,um,F
48,we all by the way have the same digit form for the record.,S
50,that's cool.,S
56,but you know which opportunity should we,D
85,yeah.,S
115,um it looks like the vocal tract length normalization is working beautifully actually.,S
129,uh,F
130,but one issue actually that just came up in discussion with liz and and don was um as far as meeting recognition is concerned um we would really like to uh move uh to uh doing the recognition on automatic segmentations.,S
158,yeah.,B
167,right now they're they're discrete.,S
171,right.,B
176,good.,F
182,the uh chuck chunks.,S
184,huh,B
187,and so he talked it over with the transcriber.,S
198,that's a great idea.,S
257,so it'd be it'd be good to sort of get that resolved uh soon as we could.,S
259,and then,D
263,i i don't know yet how long that'll take.,S
265,i mean in particular i would i would really hope that when we do this darpa meeting in july that we sort of have we're we're into production mode somehow.,S
273,maybe before we do the meeting info organize thing maybe you could say relevant stuff about where we are in transcriptions.,S
294,so it makes sense.,S
310,and this way it'll i mean i got really a lot of response for for my notice.,S
317,uh in in the day event that that day actually dawns uh i i bet we could find some other stuff for them to do.,S
374,um yeah i think it'd be interesting to combine these.,S
409,you know a completely non cheating version.,S
433,uh some other interesting things average number of speakers per meeting is six.,S
435,and i'm going to have on here the total amount that's been transcribed so far.,S
442,now would the ones that um are already transcribed we we have enough there that,D
461,it'll certainly be done by then yeah.,S
468,yeah that's right so that,D
474,well in principle yes but i mean if if if somebody actually did get into some legal issue with it then,D
491,so i think what it is is that the the the the thing that they sign i i haven't looked at it in a while but it has to be open enough that it sort of says okay from now on you know now that i've read this you can use do anything you want with these data.,S
508,well if it's only the transcript though i mean this this is my point that that,D
517,that's what adam wanted.,S
536,that would be simpler.,S
566,so let's see.,S
595,spurts wouldn't be.,S
612,i think uh,D
655,but was sort of trying to uh get a general idea.,S
659,the but the main limitation now is i because we're only looking at things that happen every ten words or every twenty words we need more more data and more data per speaker.,S
661,it'd also be interesting to look at the e d u meetings.,S
664,whether you were in a meeting recorder meeting or a robustness meeting did matter to interrupts.,S
704,yeah.,B
737,you know chuck and i talked and the next thing to do is probably to tune the um the size of the gaussian system um to to this to this feature vector which we haven't done at all.,S
759,yeah we get twelve of those.,S
765,as i said before the uh using dan's uh uh vocal tract normalization option works very well.,S
801,what's actually interesting is that with,D
894,i don't know if dan fixed it or or uh what he,D
911,i mean frankly we never did that with the rasta filter either.,S
917,um so that that was the problem there was we we we had always intended to cut off below a hundred hertz.,S
938,well that's what i meant in fact yeah.,S
949,so we but but we may not i mean if it doesn't perform as well we may not know why.,S
955,now the thing is in some databases i wouldn't expect it to necessarily give you much.,S
1022,and i'm wondering how we can how we can debug that.,S
1026,huh.,B
1070,because he's probably the one here,D
1079,and,D
1103,if you believe in the viterbi assumption that uh getting the best path uh is almost equivalent to getting the best uh total probability um then you actually do improve that by uh by training up on local local uh local frames.,S
1179,we need to close up.,S
1188,i i i think given that we're in a hurry for snacks maybe we should do them together.,S
44,okay.,F
45,um this is eric on mike one.,S
51,so basically they're kind of like sentences but with numbers instead of words.,S
59,so a short sentence between each line.,S
68,okay.,B
70,thanks.,S
76,okay.,S
87,okay.,S
97,yeah.,S
119,oh.,F
120,um because my name was was mentioned when i wasn't around.,S
153,i guess speaker change in any case.,S
165,or,D
170,yeah.,S
179,oh you're meant you're meant to speak naturally.,S
203,right.,B
243,huh.,B
266,this sounds wonderful.,S
269,i'm i'm open to,D
325,okay well you also want to get quality.,S
341,and very well known in discourse analysis.,S
360,yeah.,S
384,right i mean the it's sort of it's a little in some sense it's a little bit easier with it with switchboard.,S
410,well we'll have to go in from somewhere.,S
501,my uh my,D
510,yeah.,S
531,i mean especially in with speaker change in a meeting like this where we're overlapping so much.,S
533,i don't think we're going to have a a prayer.,S
551,yes.,S
562,well i know that i know that um the mississippi state tools at least what the produce does not come out in s t m format.,S
627,so it's it's um pretty broad based.,S
637,it'll take me just a second here.,S
642,well yeah.,S
689,i i,D
693,i mean if in terms of the the type.,S
714,it was the one that steve renals mentioned.,S
739,excellent idea.,S
741,automatic annotation of prosody in verbmobil.,S
746,but here again it's focusing on representation rather than the tools to do this.,S
780,right.,S
872,right.,S
882,if they occur to you.,S
892,right.,S
937,you know we we may or may not talk before then on that.,S
951,like if you just listen to the far p z m the person sitting at this end of the table you can hardly hear at all.,S
981,right.,S
998,so,F
999,that's what i want.,S
1069,uhhuh.,B
1073,well he can,D
1093,uhhuh.,B
1181,do we,D
1187,i mean more if we can.,S
1213,interesting.,B
1218,it really makes you feel like you're doing real work.,S
1225,and they do have dat recorders.,S
1247,yeah.,B
1285,well i don't mind.,S
1297,we've got two hours of space now.,S
16,leah leah noticed this one where i said something and um the transcriber interpreted it as twosome gruesome uh different sizes different this.,S
35,but they're not usually that bad i i don't think.,S
66,always conceivable.,S
70,well and this this would be consistent.,S
98,let's see.,S
123,if well first of all there's this overall point that it shows a degree to which when you listen to speech and when you're just in general listening probably.,S
138,it's it's not surprising that they would hear this.,S
147,okay now having said that i'm i'm impressed by how by how um well how infrequent these these kinds of extreme cases are.,S
150,uhhuh.,B
160,okay let's say i say well that would be hard to do so.,S
172,yeah.,S
186,in a way,D
192,so the example is that would be hard.,S
200,so,F
210,it it,D
342,uh this is the interpretation that came to mind or something.,S
352,yeah.,S
372,group of groups of groups of group,D
428,well maybe it's because they don't realize that you're supposed to,D
489,yeah those are actually probably just the computer problem.,S
504,selective.,S
592,uhoh!,S
611,i see what you're saying.,S
617,i have a question.,S
650,and that's that's you know i would watch the visual signal to avoid that.,D
693,no i think,D
702,uhhuh yeah.,B
714,yeah i,D
736,yeah you have to the resolution.,S
742,in terms of what it is that you like particularly and what you don't.,S
886,um one thing that's gotten me into problems a little bit is having the shift-backspace as the collapser.,S
930,you're typing capitals and you're backspacing and you're like oh take the shift off.,S
937,yeah yeah.,B
961,huh.,B
974,yeah i do that all the time.,S
1046,yeah.,S
1097,uh yeah.,S
1100,nice.,S
1150,okay.,S
1157,i've forgotten someone said that they could recognize a seven when they saw it they could see the the waveform and oh it's going to be a seven.,S
1179,yeah.,S
1182,it's a very different interface though.,S
1201,yeah i only did it a little bit too.,S
1244,but i it was um really rather minimal.,S
1271,yeah.,B
1289,actually you you also did a different type of transcription uh with respect to um our sister project.,S
1304,uhhuh so actually we started with the words.,S
1316,yeah.,S
1328,yeah.,B
1512,yeah there's some those are those are nice.,S
1529,and also that we can i don't know that we have this shared realm of knowledge kind of.,S
1537,yeah or even just about what we were talking about with the technical part you know the interface.,S
1680,i don't know.,S
1725,someone in one of these e.d.u. meetings they have a laptop.,S
1798,uhhuh.,B
1829,i had one where they were just they were just like talking about each word you know.,S
1861,oh okay we won't be that long i don't think.,S
1878,he everyone's talking.,S
1905,that's really funny.,S
1929,it is true that this is kind of an artificial.,S
1937,it's interesting because like um when i'm working late at night i actually don't feel so lonely.,S
1939,because there's so many voices in my head.,S
2009,uhhuh.,B
2051,not something i was sort of volitionally sort of,D
2069,i'll i'll do the same thing as you do.,S
2215,you know all the uh uh's and um's and all those different things,D
2232,huh.,B
2237,including i mean every little aspect.,S
2386,it's what made me think of it.,S
2389,the one you're talking,D
2395,it's good to know this.,S
2433,uhhuh.,B
2524,i've run across that also.,S
2563,so when you laugh you're exhaling all this air.,S
2606,i put breath laugh in the brackets when i don't know whether it's a breath or a laugh.,S
2646,yes they do.,S
2723,uhhuh uhhuh.,D
2754,so mainly for clarity it sounds like like in phrasing or strategies.,S
2778,i guess it depends partly on the type of interruption.,S
2794,and in a like a friendly conversation i i notice that that's not really true.,S
2801,and i i remember this actually from a meeting because liz was complaining there wasn't enough interruptions.,S
2819,because the claim had been,D
2885,yeah i don't think that these are very common.,S
2889,i wanted to draw attention to the fact that there are sometimes these stretches where a person is trying to say something and formulating their thought and they're coming out with a bunch of segments which really aren't part of a word.,S
2966,excellent.,S
2968,i put in if it's um unintelligible i put i count how many syllables and then i put in six x. .,S
3013,she could make it out probably.,S
3082,uhhuh.,B
3157,this is an interesting category to me.,S
3161,so if you're doing you're doing separate channels first and then as a final pass through the mixed channel.,S
3231,like once this is just such a,D
3235,that's that's this is just to mention an instance that happened once.,S
3239,i i i think and it may be that it was not from anybody here.,S
3241,but i think that um mumble is only useful in the to me in the sense of whispered.,S
3245,oh right.,S
3375,okay i wanted to make one comment and that is some of these are like two digits.,S
1,okay.,S
4,we haven't sent around the agenda.,S
23,well i had a just a quick quest ion.,S
58,okay.,S
63,dome.,S
84,so better quality close talking mikes.,S
90,yeah the,D
159,no but my point is,D
182,sounds sounds fine.,S
188,so yeah uniformity would be great.,S
199,yep.,S
248,so as as i said we'll do a field trip and see if we can get all of the same mike that's more comfortable than than these things which i think are horrible.,S
251,good.,S
255,it's makes our job a lot easier.,S
263,okay second item was the uh nist visit and what's going on there.,S
266,jonathan fiscus is coming on the second of february.,S
270,he expressed an interest in seeing the room.,S
279,so the room it's things like the audio and and audio and acoustic acoustic properties of the room.,S
287,yeah okay.,B
299,so i don't know.,S
310,so to to give the transcribers some information in which channel there's there's speech in addition to to the thing we we did.,S
317,yeah.,S
345,but uh he does stuff with auditory models and he's very interested in directionality and location and and uh head models and microphone things.,S
369,a little bit.,S
386,well i was just thinking you know as i was sitting here next to thilo that um when he's talking my mike probably picks it up better than your guys's mikes.,S
400,or who talks the loudest.,S
414,jonathan fiscus expressed an interest in uh microphone arrays.,S
457,all all i know is that they've been talking to me about a project that they're going to start up recording people in meetings.,S
459,and uh it is related to ours.,S
469,we're not recording a bunch of impromptu situations.,S
481,the uh the big arrays,D
493,i've seen demonstrations of the microphone arrays it's amazing how how they can cut out noise.,S
505,um,F
506,so yeah there's there's there's a range of things that people do.,S
557,i mean it seems,D
617,and the assumption that you could time align the two.,S
648,yeah we can offer the meetings and the physical space.,S
656,but it's if it's impossible or if it's a lot of effort then you have to just balance the two.,S
660,right.,B
731,i don't care.,S
736,usually.,S
754,so i wanted to keep it clear whose data were whose.,S
756,uhhuh.,B
767,just out of curiosity i asked one of them how long it was taking her one of these two who has already finished her data set.,S
798,you know i i explained you know the reasons that that we were not coding more elaborately.,S
806,sorry.,F
807,can you explain what the atlas,D
936,uhhuh.,B
948,yeah well,F
949,but they're not giving really fine time markings.,S
956,because,D
975,uh some point ago we thought that uh it boy we'd really have to ramp up to do that.,S
987,well i'm i'm wondering now if it's,D
1019,uh don has been taking a first stab actually using jane's first the the meeting that jane transcribed.,S
1024,the s r i,D
1031,yeah.,F
1032,and after a minute or so it's it's way better.,S
1034,so we have to sort of normalize the front end and so forth and have these small segments.,S
1046,oh i see.,S
1085,after they,D
1090,yeah i'm sure they will.,S
1093,i mean it sounds like liz has some concerns.,S
1096,uh i don't know maybe it's saved out in pieces or or something that would help.,S
1099,uh it's just an unknown right now.,S
1102,i just you know it's like i got over taxed with the timing.,S
1106,i mean that's that's a good length.,S
1155,we have all the data transcribed.,S
1163,two questions come is you know what how how do we,D
1198,that would be really valuable i think.,S
1200,we could do it on some small subset.,S
1232,that's nice.,S
1252,but is is the goal there to have this on meeting data,D
1298,i guess i wanted to um sort of make a pitch for trying to collect more meetings.,S
1301,yeah.,B
1342,it would be very hard for them.,S
1360,so i actually wrote to him and he answered great that sounds really interesting.,S
1370,um so it's still worthwhile,D
1373,so i didn't have to do it each time.,S
1394,of course some of that can be done lexically.,S
1406,they'd be really good.,S
1448,yeah so i mean there's possibilities there.,S
1475,okay.,S
1490,yeah.,F
1491,yeah.,S
1494,yeah.,B
1502,of course there is this problem though that if we give them the chance to excise later we might end up with like five minutes out of a of one hour,D
1519,okay.,S
1525,and i had one other one other aspect of this.,S
1536,the all native.,S
1566,uh the worst match was people whose native tongue was mandarin chinese.,S
1600,it's pretty tough uh this group yeah.,S
1633,if anyone has ideas.,S
1654,huh,B
1668,well far field mikes can pick up where they threw stuff on the wall.,S
1676,please throw everything in that direction.,S
1678,yeah anyway.,B
1723,it doesn't seem like big room acoustics problems to my ear.,S
1762,yeah may i i only display the different colors for the different situation.,S
1820,the problem is just that the acoustic,D
1838,but we probably will have to do something like that in addition.,S
1843,uh,F
1844,tea has started out there i suggest we run through our digits.,S
1846,okay.,S
1849,okay we're done.,S
62,as the synthesis doesn't have to be transcribed i think.,S
64,so,F
65,yeah.,F
66,so so it's basically one channel to transcribe.,S
75,yeah.,B
79,yep.,B
118,i mean that's my intention.,S
122,yeah.,B
137,but that is a good point so we'll get to that too.,S
150,so i think we'll have something.,S
162,oh well.,S
164,and also um i was just showing andreas i got um an x waves kind of display.,S
176,okay so again the issue is for july the issue's going to be what can we fit into a windows machine uh and so on.,S
179,okay.,S
201,yeah.,F
202,but but the problem is the version transcriber works with the snack version is one point six whatever.,S
242,just three different,D
246,but but it would be cool if the transcriber interface had like another window for the you know maybe above the waveform where it would show some arbitrary valued function that is that is you know time time synchronous with the waveform.,S
290,i just thought if you meant slides i thought you meant like just like um view graphs or something.,S
293,so uh,D
303,um anyway just looking for ways that we could actually show what you're doing uh in to people.,S
402,so but that but,D
424,and we won't be using the old ones anymore.,S
497,i would like to.,S
548,i think dave dave knows all these things of course.,S
557,well.,F
558,so,D
590,no the the problem with that apparently is that they don't currently have a wire running to that back room that goes anywhere near one of the icsi routers.,S
594,yeah again you know any one of these things is certainly not a big deal.,S
609,let's see.,F
610,the only thing other thing i was going to add was that um uh i talked briefly to mari.,S
624,so uh we can,D
629,or,D
639,so what i meant was on the this meeting if i something i i i'm making a major thing in the agenda is i want to help in getting together a list of what it is that we've done so i can tell her.,S
646,uh and then the next day uh late in the day i'll be having that that discussion with her.,S
649,um uh one thing i mean we in past meetings we had um also you know various variously talked about the um work that uh was happening sort of on the on the recognition side.,S
673,uh uh,F
674,liz and jane probably.,S
695,yeah.,B
753,uhhuh.,B
756,so um,F
757,okay.,B
794,we clearly got to add a few more features though.,S
803,right.,B
812,so so one one compromise would be to only to have the everything up to the point where you generate lattices be basically one system.,S
818,i i think so.,S
825,um you know just wanted to let you know that that's working out very nicely.,S
850,because we're doing,D
866,right.,B
927,although we i mean it's not that many fewer and and and we take a k l t anyway so we could,D
929,exactly.,F
930,so so that was the other thing.,S
998,uh we never did any,D
1005,so we were,D
1008,we were probably at least a factor or two off.,S
1017,it's the it's the conversational speech bit.,S
1073,which i've never figured out.,S
1081,yeah.,B
1083,well that might probably just,D
1085,that was probably because your initial system i mean your system was worse than cambridge's.,S
1190,but i think that that uh at some point there's diminishing returns.,S
1232,yeah definitely not the one thousand uh two thousand,D
1238,maybe i'll start off with two thousand just to see.,S
1250,right.,F
1251,i actually have to go.,S
1253,all right.,S
1266,if,D
5,where this came up was that uh i was showing off these wave forms that we have on the web.,S
8,so,F
9,i i have to be more careful about using that as a as a as a good illustration.,S
13,so,F
14,and then we had this other discussion about um whether this affects the dynamic range.,S
19,so there was a question of whether we should change things here.,S
30,yeah.,S
40,yeah.,F
41,so when we're doing all these things using our software there is,D
50,i don't know.,S
76,well if they made output.,S
86,yeah.,B
88,so it was it was a bad example in that way.,S
92,yeah someone noticed it later pointed it out to me and i went oh man.,S
96,so i think we'll change our our picture on the web when we're,D
158,okay.,S
162,yeah so,D
184,well the other system are for instance,D
273,well,F
274,i did notice uh something,D
301,yeah easily four times as many parameters.,S
313,but one one thing i i wanted to check out before i increased the um number of mixtures per state was uh in their default training script they do an initial set of three re estimations.,S
340,so i wanted to experiment with cutting down the number of iterations before i increased the number of gaussians.,S
400,that's why i've been saying we should be looking at word error rate uh and and not not at at accuracies.,S
408,uhhuh.,B
427,huh.,B
429,well anyway,F
430,uh,F
431,so,F
432,yeah so it hurts a little bit on the well match.,S
434,yeah.,S
441,hey morgan.,S
471,ninety three point six four.,S
482,my baseline is the submitted system.,S
488,yeah.,F
489,for finnish we start to ninety three point eight four.,S
500,do you know what,D
508,and the other things like um downsampling upsampling don't seem to hurt.,S
512,i'm really confused about something.,S
531,yeah.,S
543,i mean so uh here's all the if if in all these different cases it never gets better and there's significant number of cases where it gets worse then you're probably hurting things i would say.,S
552,well we are exchanging mail as soon as we we have significant results.,S
555,yeah.,B
559,yeah.,B
566,yeah.,S
574,there is this eurospeech deadline.,S
576,i see.,S
578,yeah.,F
579,but yeah.,F
580,as soon as we have something that's significant and that's better than than what was submitted.,S
583,but we've not discussed it it it this yet.,S
605,yeah.,D
612,the deadline is in may.,S
628,oh.,S
657,good.,S
661,oh great.,S
675,i mean actually the the,D
677,it made a good good audio demonstration because when we could play that clip the the the really obvious difference is that you can hear two voices and in the second one and only hear,D
687,that actually that makes for a perfectly good demo.,S
712,right.,S
717,so,F
718,yeah.,F
719,so there are clearly are spectral effects.,S
726,after after uh they were put in there i didn't really look at them anymore.,S
730,oh.,S
735,uhhuh.,B
748,um,F
749,uh yeah.,S
751,i brought some i don't know if some figures here.,S
769,and the sentence contain only one word which is due.,S
782,uhhuh.,B
800,what we can clearly see is that on the speech portion the two channel come becomes very close.,S
820,no.,S
829,well i mean because everything uh if you have a system based on gaussians everything is based on means and variances.,S
884,voice activity detection is not an easy thing neither.,S
890,so what i notice is that while i prefer to look at the second figure than at the third one.,S
894,but the problem is that on the speech portion channel zero and channel one are more different .than when you use variance normalization where channel zero and channel one become closer.,S
905,for i i think that it perhaps it shows that uh the parameters that the voice activity detector should use uh have to use should be different than the parameter that have to be used for speech recognition.,S
915,well it's just to,D
930,where's,D
933,yeah.,B
967,yeah and also to understand what happens because,D
970,well when we do spectral subtraction actually i think that this is the the two last figures.,S
986,so yeah.,F
987,and what they did at o g i is just uh they don't use online normalization for the moment on spectral subtraction.,S
990,i think as soon as they will try online normalization there will be a problem.,S
993,with different different system.,S
995,right.,F
996,i mean the,D
1006,just just asking.,S
1010,there also could be i mean i can maybe see a reason for both working on it too.,S
1026,yeah but i think,D
1030,uh yeah.,F
1031,we we will try m s g.,S
1034,and they are,D
1040,okay.,F
1048,um yeah the other thing is that you saw that that mail about uh the v a d v a d's performing quite differently.,S
1051,so um,F
1067,i i don't know which which one.,S
1070,um we should ask which v a d she used.,S
1086,so if they have a better one we should use it.,S
1093,yeah so we should find out if it's really better.,S
1105,and start start organizing uh more visits and connections and so forth.,S
1108,uh,F
1109,working towards june.,S
1133,so there would be more,D
1139,right.,B
1142,when you have noise there is no,D
1145,yeah you can make these mistakes.,S
1147,but but,D
1162,yeah.,B
1166,i thought that you or somebody was talking about,D
1168,so,D
1172,so go ahead.,S
1177,yeah so i don't know.,S
1183,larry saul could be an idea.,S
1195,you from that you you estimate,D
1209,uhhuh.,B
1226,uh,F
1227,works okay.,S
1232,but the thing is that you can't,D
1239,i guess we could,D
1250,so that's voice activity detector as opposed to voicing detector.,S
1301,uh um,F
1302,i see yeah uhhuh.,S
1311,yeah that's a good idea.,S
1318,well it's this musical noise which is annoying if you you do some kind of online normalization after.,S
1321,um,F
1322,yeah.,B
1336,uhhuh.,B
1369,we need labels.,S
1381,um yeah.,F
1382,but you could i mean you can you can align so that it's not perfect.,S
1385,but the problem is that their models are all word level models.,S
1401,but i don't know.,S
1406,yeah.,F
1407,and to have an idea of how much we can gain.,S
1409,i mean in experiments that we did a long time ago,D
1415,another person's voice.,D
1424,huh.,B
1426,well back twenty years ago when i did this voiced unvoiced stuff we were getting more like ninety seven or ninety eight percent correct in voicing.,S
1444,looking at envelope only that we'd be significantly worse than that.,S
1465,okay.,S
1470,actually i i we didn't i guess i wrote this in after the meeting.,S
1494,i mean if there's some testing data that has has has two or three,D
1496,but i just thought that was a little odd.,S
1512,huh.,B
1516,huh.,B
30,oh yeah that's right.,D
76,so the,D
79,yes.,S
121,and you just have to bring it up.,S
129,hhh okay.,B
131,but it's not such a it's not such a directional microphone probably.,S
139,yeah we maybe we should look into if we can buy a replacement.,S
162,i noticed that.,S
194,still i i i mean i'm kind of more deaf on this ear whatever this is on.,S
218,but,F
219,no.,S
224,but they're just very very sensitive.,S
242,okay.,S
271,no i mean the,D
282,right.,S
290,oh right right right.,S
303,huh.,B
314,i find this one is no problem at all.,S
332,can can't we buy an expander that you just,D
356,i mean this thing wearing that that can,D
358,it's wired.,S
364,oh.,S
396,so for about four years i used dragondictate and naturallyspeaking.,S
415,so,F
416,huh.,B
429,that's how i ended up working on this project instead.,S
434,so yeah.,F
437,yeah.,S
456,and there is all this work on transcription.,S
460,but worse you know environmental conditions.,S
469,we didn't dare to say it will be just in a p.d.a. you throw in the middle of a meeting.,S
473,yeah.,F
474,this is this is,D
489,yeah.,B
530,yeah.,B
536,as you said to i mean we would like the idea to have it there.,S
538,but but our focus is basically to develop the algorithms to push the state of the art on this transcription task.,S
542,right.,B
560,as i said the meeting recorder project,D
605,you know.,F
606,it's it's a good property for us that there are a lot of different things you could do with it.,S
615,yeah.,B
627,i mean it's one of the areas where kemal is going to work like you know speaker tracking and speaker i.d.,S
633,you want to know.,S
655,yeah for example when you go to your p.d.a. system it's uh really an awful open problem to determine how many speakers there are and where they change turns.,S
659,yeah.,B
694,because they were saying some some some up to eight speakers maybe they,D
708,no.,F
709,we've also uh done some of that as uh uh,D
717,yeah uh for for broadcast news it works much better actually.,S
723,right.,S
726,but of course we don't have any trained neural nets.,S
728,so so his system was based on our hybrid neural net system that we use for speech recognition.,S
751,there are there are some with a lot of overlap.,S
762,and they it's a lot clean.,S
775,uh yeah.,F
776,yeah.,B
793,the host probably gets uh you know gets a little bit more.,S
857,i mean we clearly should collaborate for the best of everybody.,S
861,i you know,D
875,switchboard for instance.,S
915,there's some possibility that we're going to get a third party company to do the transcription for us in exchange for the corpus.,S
953,and then uh u.w.,D
962,this would never go away.,S
966,it's,D
992,ha!,D
1010,yeah.,S
1012,so knowing that an utterance is really short and low volume you should be able to figure out it's a backchannel and things like that.,S
1014,apparently and you guys know more than i do there was some talk that you were going to build a portable version of this so that mari's group,D
1034,we we talked about that and it was,D
1038,well when i spoke with him he he really just said it was a money issue.,S
1050,i think i think somebody's got a unit which is something like the a. dat or something.,S
1066,and so if we if they could lend us that we could imagine doing these kinds of recordings.,S
1075,right.,S
1094,well.,F
1095,one thing that horacio hadn't mentioned is,D
1097,i mean you were talking about uh the same the same sort of idea of just collecting a meeting and and looking at it afterwards.,S
1101,and,F
1102,so that's probably that's probably what,D
1107,and it,D
1111,so you know what we're we're basically doing is is waiting to look at the pilot and see what people want to do.,S
1138,and it's all of these things is a,D
1150,but it's like you know if it really was an intelligent assistant sitting there you could say oh perhaps the computer could show us this.,S
1163,yeah.,B
1166,right.,S
1176,so the kinds of you know the kinds of speech is the speech is going to be slightly different.,S
1181,but we will have the you know we'll we'll have all this all the microphones set up all the same.,S
1184,and,D
1196,there's there's some integration of the standards thing.,S
1212,i i think it's,D
1217,not not the transcript formatting but the audio formatting and the sort of figuring out how to synchronize all of these um pieces.,S
1265,even if we don't make any decisions we'll have a lot of data.,S
1277,when you're talking about your artificial meetings they are going to be goal directed though.,S
1291,so that will be different.,S
1307,and we have eight channels.,S
1309,it's also i think uh sort of what came up i think when even liz was uh involved a little while ago with and christine i think just in terms of the thinking of the subjects and trying to have enough people.,S
1313,so if,D
1326,huh.,B
1353,not like say okay.,S
1369,yeah that,D
1386,that's,D
1401,we thought that would be a be a useful kind of task for budget meetings or that kind of thing.,S
1427,sort of,D
1434,good.,S
1436,i i think that's close enough to what we're interested in that it would it'd be useful for training uh the acoustic models without any question.,S
1454,or i mean is the intention to do some,D
1477,yeah.,B
1482,yeah.,B
1488,having people read digit strings.,S
1493,oh that's really interesting.,S
1534,i think just just having stereo will help.,S
1541,uh you combine them together and you do a little better.,S
1576,but i mean,D
1586,oh the,D
1598,oh.,S
1603,you can have my mike.,S
1617,one thing i should point out we were we were not planning on doing transcription of the full thing right away.,S
1643,i heard a,D
1681,but how much how valuable,D
1691,yeah.,B
1697,right.,B
1720,but anyway what i was going to say is that although we're not going to have speech directed to a computer my expectation is that the acoustic models will be very similar.,S
1742,which is you know we need a natural language grammar written anyway.,S
1757,yeah that's that's the way we've been approaching it.,S
1761,if we're going to be able to interpret it then i mean if we're not going to be able to interpret that then it's not going to do us much good anyway to recognize it.,S
1773,except,D
1777,well indeed.,S
1783,well i know they're all working on mediated spaces.,S
1801,well so we haven't even you know we haven't collected a byte yet.,S
1805,because i mean you're both working on it and with you know different sampling rates and these silly things like that.,S
1817,and we have the same sampling rate.,S
1840,yeah.,F
1841,um,F
1842,well but that's that was coincidence right?,S
1844,but that,D
1852,yeah.,B
1859,which is it's it's very good.,S
1863,um so we're actually,D
1871,uh,F
1872,right of it.,S
1894,but s.r.i. in general is is the,D
1901,well.,F
1902,and u.w. is also probably going to be interested in that too.,S
1907,so it seems like um if you and jane,D
1945,huh.,B
1958,uhhuh.,B
2012,especially if you have a tool that can do this.,S
2024,yeah.,B
2061,i don't know.,F
2062,maybe it's something that could fit easier in in our context than in a general meeting context.,S
2064,well what i can say is that sometimes you know if if if we were to have this kind of coordination thing some some of the overlap is due to someone wanting to claim the floor at a certain point.,S
2071,or yeah.,S
2108,so i i,D
2117,but sorry.,S
2149,one of the specific things i'm interested in is knowing um is the open mike issue.,S
2153,oh cool.,S
2157,yeah.,B
2184,i mean people that do prosody work they add a few at the end.,S
2193,yeah.,B
2223,there'll be a common,D
2243,yeah.,S
2259,yeah.,S
2264,that's right.,S
2282,maybe we know them.,S
2313,i mean we could just make make numbers up.,S
2315,i don't know.,F
2316,it's it's a different task.,S
2324,right.,B
2327,uhhuh.,B
2347,and it makes a huge difference.,S
2388,although unfortunately you know they're all pretty close.,S
220,sure.,B
342,how about,D
418,huh.,B
428,um and then the next are two sections.,S
456,uhhuh.,B
495,they had divided things up into regions.,S
506,every block of london has a different,D
509,yeah.,S
552,just,D
568,somebody's going to have to do some data,D
728,well i you know i i was thinking of it as,D
793,uhhuh.,B
826,but again it depends how fine we want to get.,S
856,well i i,D
858,so,F
859,i don't think it was ever the intent to talk about the region now.,S
894,yeah i guess i'll fiddle around yet again with the language stuff.,S
905,right.,S
977,yeah.,B
1130,well realize this was the idea was that this would be meeting specific.,S
1178,it's sort of a research question you you're analyzing the meeting and you're deciding uh there's this kind of structure to it.,S
1213,and systematize also maybe the encoding of it if as we find some are useful and some are not so useful.,S
1244,okay enough on forms.,S
1251,so i i guess you've sent off this the uh c d roms.,S
1258,was there some suggestion that they might soon or,D
1268,and so he sent me email and said he's going to be starting to work on it.,S
1272,well that was that one.,S
1275,so tomorrow i'll send a email and just ask if he received it.,S
1427,i use the mixed signal without normalization without normalization.,S
1431,exactly.,S
1455,yeah.,B
1492,because,D
1530,no.,S
1584,well just in in each case take a take a take a frame.,S
1587,if it's if it's voiced include it.,S
1599,i guess you'd,D
1655,yeah.,B
1684,uh what,D
1763,and uh i i had to to to change all all the points in the in the code uh to substitute uh for another way.,S
1773,okay.,S
4,i won't be here thursday and friday.,S
11,okay.,S
18,okay.,S
24,because the one thing the one thing that seems to me we really should try if you hadn't tried it before because it hadn't occurred to me.,S
31,so i've tried playing around a little bit with um the insertion penalties and things like that.,S
34,i mean it it didn't make a whole lot of difference.,S
38,and see.,S
55,let's just,D
70,i think that's uh that's kind of a first order thing that that we should try.,S
79,i mean don't want to do this over a hundred different things that they've tried.,S
92,yeah i didn't even write them down.,S
97,so when i was doing i just wrote down some numbers for the well matched case.,S
100,looking at the i wrote down what the deletions substitutions and insertions were.,S
102,for different numbers of states per phone.,S
107,i i would,D
112,i can do that for next week.,S
115,yeah.,F
116,also uh uh sometimes if you run behind on some of these things maybe we can get someone else to do it.,S
119,but i think it would be it'd be good to know that.,S
147,uh,F
148,part of what's going on um is the uh the range of values.,S
160,that has a similar effect.,S
176,so if we know what the insertion penalty is then we can get an idea about what range our number should be in.,S
199,i could look at it at this.,S
201,yeah.,S
222,right.,B
227,and it may be less of a critical thing.,S
238,uh,F
239,um,F
240,if you're operating in the wrong range i mean that's why just in general if you change what these these penalties and scaling factors are you reach some point that's a that's a minimum.,S
242,um,F
243,um,F
244,we do have to do well over a range of different conditions.,S
247,but um i think we may get a better handle on that if we if we see,D
251,even though it's it's it's true that in a real situation you can in fact adjust the these these scaling factors in the back end and it's artificial here that we're not adjusting those you certainly don't want to be adjusting those all the time.,S
260,once we knew what roughly the right operating range was it was pretty stable.,S
284,so,F
285,uh,F
286,i just sort of think we need to explore the space.,S
294,as for these other things it may turn out that uh it's kind of reasonable.,S
315,okay.,F
316,so uh,F
319,so there's nothing new.,S
327,well so we've been mainly working on the report.,S
329,yeah.,F
334,how about that,D
336,that's all.,S
344,voicing thing.,S
358,yeah.,S
373,yeah.,F
374,if i can summarize basically what's going on is that you're going over a lot of material that you have generated in furious fashion.,S
379,yeah basically we've stopped uh experimenting.,S
398,so my suggestion though is that you you not necessarily finish that.,S
427,but you you may really want to add other things later anyway.,S
435,so i don't know there are small things that we started to to do.,S
441,or,F
442,yeah.,S
450,um,F
451,yeah yeah.,F
452,we have yeah extracted actually the noises from the speechdat car.,S
454,we can train neural network with speech and these noises.,S
456,it's difficult to say what it will give.,S
462,adding the noises from from the speechdat car.,S
464,that's,D
468,well,F
469,o g i does did that.,S
471,at some point they did that for for the voice activity detector.,S
475,could you say it again.,S
481,i guess that's a matter of interpretation.,S
494,uh,F
495,uh,F
496,and it is true that the performance uh on the german was,D
500,and uh,F
501,it it doesn't appear that there's strong evidence that even though things were somewhat tuned on those three or four languages that that going to a different language really hurt you.,S
506,i mean they were different drives.,S
512,um it's somewhat tuned.,S
520,um i guess it's okay.,S
530,well it's true.,S
536,and they didn't forbid us.,S
547,but uh,F
548,it's true.,S
578,right.,F
579,i mean again if you had the whole system you were optimizing that would be easy to see.,S
584,uhhuh.,B
619,yeah.,S
630,so whatever it was it would have to be uh sort of on a per frame basis.,S
636,yeah.,B
645,you know third formant,D
654,although you frequently get less distinct higher formants it's still third formant's kind of a reasonable compromise.,S
656,uhhuh.,B
660,but um that doesn't work for just having one frame or something.,S
668,so,F
669,but on the other hand male female is a is a is a much simpler categorization than figuring out a a factor to uh squish or expand the the spectrum.,S
672,you could imagine that,D
677,but you'd have to figure out a way to to to uh incorporate it on the fly.,S
681,you know.,F
682,but,D
684,i don't know if that would really help.,S
688,is it,D
694,almost.,S
700,you're you were saying before.,S
702,so this noise,D
704,yeah the m s g,D
706,huh,F
707,there is something perhaps i could spend some days to look at this thing.,S
710,um,F
711,when they are used on on the speechdat car data it's not the case.,S
735,uhhuh.,B
737,m s g is very very,D
745,you always have to look at how this uh these adjustments uh affect things.,S
754,yeah.,F
755,but it's it's after,D
758,huh,F
759,yeah.,B
765,i don't know.,S
771,doesn't tell you what the variance of the things is.,S
777,knowing what the sum of the probabilities are doesn't tell you what the sum of the logs are.,S
781,yeah.,F
782,so we should look at the likelihood.,S
784,what,D
786,well,F
787,at the log perhaps.,S
789,yeah.,B
799,and so the uh for the tandem system the values that come out of the net don't go through the sigmoid.,S
812,they aren't normalized after that.,S
820,right.,F
821,so the question is yeah whatever they are at that point um are they something for which taking a square root or cube root or fourth root or something like that is is going to be a good or a bad thing.,S
823,uhhuh.,B
831,so,F
832,um,F
833,anyway uh,F
834,yeah.,F
835,because if if the log probs that are coming out of the m s g are really big the standard insertion penalty is going to have very little effect.,S
837,right.,S
849,yeah.,F
850,it may be entirely off.,S
856,if there's a fairly large effect of the difference say uh uh the ratio between insertions and deletions for the two cases then that would be uh an indicator that it might might be in that direction.,S
861,my my point was more that it it works sometimes.,S
866,well.,F
867,and it works on t i digits.,S
872,yeah.,F
873,well.,F
874,but you know some problems are harder than others.,S
878,and uh sometimes you know there's enough evidence for something to work.,S
889,yeah sure.,S
891,huh.,B
894,well.,F
895,there is also the spectral subtraction.,S
898,i think maybe we should uh try to integrate it in in our system.,S
904,i think that would involve to to huh use a big a already a big bunch of the system of ericsson.,S
910,and i i think it's important um to reduce this musical noise and this this increase of variance during silence portions.,S
912,well.,F
913,this was this would involve to take almost everything from from the this proposal.,S
915,and then just add some kind of on line normalization in in the neural network.,S
928,i took a lot of time just getting my taxes out of the way.,S
940,okay.,S
942,i'll uh,F
943,you know he's,D
953,i'll try to connect with him and people as as i can on on wednesday.,S
955,um,F
960,that's just that's that's one of the big advantages of not making much money is the taxes are easier.,S
962,unless you're getting money in two countries.,S
986,um,F
987,yeah.,B
994,uh,F
999,right.,S
1005,um,F
1006,yeah.,S
1013,okay.,S
1018,so,F
1019,um,F
1020,so once,D
1023,once we,D
1034,so in this paper um it's talking about phoneme recognition using acoustic events.,S
1038,this is a paper by hubener and cardson benson berndsen.,S
1045,yeah i think the,D
1074,um,F
1075,called them avents.,S
1079,and the the the idea was something that occurred that is important to a bunch of neurons somewhere.,S
1081,uhhuh.,B
1087,it's kind of like the difference between top down and bottom up.,S
1107,yeah.,F
1108,okay.,S
1111,using these these events um you know we can we can perform these these uh cheating experiments.,S
1114,um,F
1115,and then from that point on i would uh design robust event detectors um in a similar um spirit that saul has done uh with his graphical models and this this probabilistic and or model that he uses.,S
1117,uh try to extend it to um to account for other other phenomena like um c m r co modulation release.,S
1119,um,F
1120,and maybe also investigate ways to to modify the structure of these models um in a data driven way.,S
1123,and while i'm i'm doing these um event detectors you know i can measure my progress by comparing um the error rates in clean and noisy conditions to something like uh neural nets.,S
1125,and,F
1126,so,F
1127,so once we have these these uh event detectors um we could put them together and and feed the outputs of the event detectors into into the s r i um h m m h m m system.,S
1129,um,F
1130,and test it on on switchboard or um maybe even aurora stuff.,S
1132,that's pretty much the the big picture of of um the plan.,S
1134,um,F
1135,there's uh a couple people who are going to be here.,S
1140,uh there's a professor kollmeier uh from germany.,S
1146,um,F
1147,um i think they'll be interesting to talk to in this sort of issue.,S
1153,okay.,B
1155,well,F
1156,short meeting.,S
1159,we might as well do our digits.,S
16,uhhuh.,B
30,uhhuh.,B
47,and uh and and i guess actually uh after eurospeech for a little bit uh he'll go up there too.,S
102,yeah for this stuff i don't think we're quite up to that.,S
111,yeah.,B
113,okay.,S
121,huh since the meeting,D
127,but i guess maybe the thing since you weren't you guys weren't at that that meeting might be just just to um sort of recap uh the the conclusions of the meeting.,S
132,yeah.,S
140,i mean this software that these guys created was certainly a a key part.,S
145,that's that's nice.,S
149,uh maybe describe roughly what what we are keeping constant for now.,S
151,yeah.,F
152,well so we've been working like six weeks on on the noise compensation and we end up with something that seems reasonable.,S
160,and uh,F
170,oh it's on the transfer function for the wiener filter.,S
176,well finally we end up with this configuration that works uh quite well.,S
180,actually let me uh dave isn't here to talk about it but let me just interject.,S
186,uh well you don't i guess you don't re synthesize speech but you could.,S
211,yeah.,B
234,um so there's this noise suppression thing which is sort of worked out.,S
262,yeah.,S
264,and finally frame dropping which um would be a neural network also used for estimated silence probabilities.,S
285,there's a question about exactly how we do it.,S
290,um i think tony robinson used to do i was saying this before i think he used to do mel uh spectra and mel cepstra.,S
303,uhhuh.,S
312,would it i mean but,D
318,well ranking didn't before but i'm just asking where this is to where theirs was without the german and danish.,S
344,i it is a triumph.,S
356,yeah.,B
397,so i think the thing is since we're not evidently throwing away useful information let's try to put in some useful information.,S
404,and you know in the long run having something everybody will look at and say oh yeah i understand is is very helpful.,S
410,because that happens before the mel conversion.,S
416,i sort of think you should.,S
420,uh,F
476,yeah if it has to fit the delays and all this stuff.,S
489,and so i guess the issue there is are we are we using neural net based traps.,S
499,and maybe for v a d they would be okay.,S
510,uh putting a nonlinearity on it is you know not that big a deal.,S
518,uhhuh.,B
532,so i'll um i'll actually after the meeting i'll add the second stream to the vad and maybe i'll start with the feature net in that case.,S
534,it's like you're looking at the v a d.,S
547,but yeah i think there are plenty of issues to work on for the feature net.,S
553,um,F
554,have you ever,D
574,that's what,D
614,and we may be able to revisit this idea about you know somehow modifying our features to work with,D
622,uh but um,F
623,yeah the other thing is that even though it's months away uh it's starting to seem to me now like november fifteenth is right around the corner.,S
635,anyway.,S
694,um,F
695,but i think it's trained on clean and,D
715,that's that.,S
764,in fact i mean if you look into it a little bit it might be reasonable,D
788,so,F
789,uh yeah and just um maybe see.,S
792,do you have hari's uh,D
819,we can for september we can set up a work schedule and we can maybe work independently.,S
836,well i've been reading some literature about clustering of data.,S
882,yeah.,F
883,yeah i mean it seems somehow that needs uh there's a couple things that i wonder about with this.,S
930,yeah.,B
932,um,F
933,anyway that's my thought.,S
943,uhhuh.,B
960,so the question is how far down.,S
977,words aren't bad yeah.,S
1022,right.,F
1023,if you can put the words in to the loop somehow for determining goodness of your sets of clusters uh,D
1043,i'm not sure how how to build that in.,S
1045,yeah.,F
1046,i mean i guess the other thing is is to think of a little bit.,S
1074,uh,F
1075,if we're not working on that then we should work on something else and improve it.,S
1,if we can't we can't but uh we're going to try to make this an abbreviated meeting.,S
4,um.,F
5,so,F
6,agenda is according to this is transcription status darpa demos x m l tools disks backups et cetera and crosspads.,S
19,and uh,F
20,uh i've been uh finishing up the uh double checking.,S
182,yeah that that sounds reasonable.,S
203,it certainly helps.,S
213,and you have to have all the,D
231,i'll check at that.,S
273,we have,D
304,yeah.,B
310,um,F
311,my experience with the gnu compatibility library is really it's just as hard and just as easy to port to any system.,S
326,uh and part of that was showing off what the speech non uh nonspeech stuff that thilo has done looks like.,S
341,you know you can show that graphically sort of what the features are doing.,S
355,um,F
356,yeah we can probably find some examples of different type of prosodic events going on.,S
400,so i've been doing a bunch of x m l tools.,S
405,so yet again we should probably meet to talk about transcription formats in x m l.,S
412,yeah.,B
455,oh but that might just be me.,S
458,all right.,B
480,some of these are missing.,S
498,i mean this is why i want to use a a tool to do it rather than the plain text.,S
504,um if you use the edit key,D
521,right well i i just realized i hadn't been doing it.,S
532,i don't,D
539,yeah that's because you,D
545,and then uh also in a couple of places instead of filling the participants under participants they were filled in under description.,S
548,and so that's also a problem.,S
573,yeah.,B
596,um i spoke with dave johnson about putting all the meeting recorder stuff on non backed up disk to save the overhead of backup.,S
613,yeah but he said that that we shouldn't worry too much about that.,S
631,and i i think i agree with him.,S
662,so,F
663,does and that does that mean i,D
668,wonderful.,S
685,couple times.,S
690,but,F
691,my opinion on it is,D
705,i don't know.,S
722,not just the you know microphone stuff but also summarization and so forth.,S
740,yep.,B
764,in in other words you can use that just to highlight times in a very simple way.,S
771,i know we haven't been using it.,S
778,and and and put some kind of summary or something.,S
787,i mean that was one of the issues we talked about originally.,S
820,yeah.,B
838,and so forth.,S
841,you know i don't know if you want to really do do this all the time.,S
845,and if so it's probably worth having one.,S
862,so what kind of input would you be,D
890,i like this p d a idea.,S
916,well and not just for you.,S
958,you know maybe someone who wants to do this as their main like project for something would be cool.,S
971,yeah.,B
980,huh.,B
986,oh!,F
1020,all right.,F
1021,so just the transcript number and then the then the,D
1053,a one and a two and a three.,S
14,that's good.,S
16,yeah well maybe we can start with this.,S
22,yeah so there was this conference call this morning.,S
24,and the only topic on the agenda was just to discuss.,S
36,included including everything.,S
53,it's it's primary primarily determined by the v a d at this point.,S
72,okay.,D
74,uh yeah so the second thing is the system that we have currently.,S
96,and i don't know how much this can be discussed or not.,S
100,how much memory how many,D
103,yeah i i i have to check that.,S
121,and one of the trick was to um use some kind of hierarchical structure.,S
124,so apparently it looks better when uh we use the silence probability from the v a d network.,S
128,so it's some kind of hierarchical thing uh that sunil also tried um on spine.,S
132,yeah the reason why why we did that with the silence probability was that um,D
148,the v a d network is,D
152,so we have a network for the v a d which has one hundred hidden units.,S
155,so it's smaller.,S
160,well it looks strange.,S
170,so well things are not optimal.,S
172,yeah.,B
174,are you you were going to say why what made you what led you to do that.,S
178,huh,D
182,so it looked strange.,S
186,yeah the next thing we will do is train this tandem on more data.,S
188,so you know in a way what it might it's it's a little bit like combining knowledge sources.,S
194,if you have um the distribution that you have from uh speech sounds is sort of one source of knowledge.,S
205,and and the features are different also.,S
212,that might be the key actually.,S
229,uh but their noise estimation.,S
231,i mean back on the second stream.,S
251,yeah and the other thing that noise estimation.,S
258,so we have uh to try to get rid of these this problem.,S
271,yeah the last thing is that i think we are getting close to human performance.,S
275,i did like um i did uh listen to the most noisy utterances of the speechdat car italian.,S
278,so this is a particular human.,S
288,but still uh what happens is is that uh the digit error rate on this is around one percent.,S
295,well you can argue that uh that this is not speech.,S
310,and the second thing is which is maybe more interesting is that um if you do it with whispered speech you get this number.,S
317,see that's the question.,S
324,if on the other hand if it stayed up near five percent then i'd say boy l p c twelve is pretty crummy.,S
333,well you're not doing the l p c,D
349,huh,D
380,if you listen to them they still might not be very even if you made something closer to what we're going to it might not sound very good.,S
411,so uh,F
412,uh but i don't know.,S
458,that's what i was thinking by doing this experiment.,S
468,uhhuh.,B
473,yeah that's it.,S
481,um,F
482,so it's,D
532,i mean we,D
563,yeah.,B
570,they're i'm still waiting for them to release the um multi c.p.u. version of their scripts.,S
602,huh.,D
617,uh frankly i don't know.,S
625,oh yeah so we should have a look at this.,S
634,anyway.,S
640,uhhuh.,B
644,it seems reasonable that that at least should be tweaked to match the front end.,S
656,but then he wasn't asked to run it for anybody.,S
689,uhhuh.,B
713,as part of the process of figuring out the scaling of these features you know if we're going to take it to a root or to a power or something we have some back end that we attach onto our features that sort of simulates what would be happening.,S
734,uhhuh.,B
765,okay.,D
768,they're they're trying to put in sort of all of the standard features that people use nowadays.,S
782,uhhuh.,S
788,uhhuh.,B
820,they said they they sort of see it in a way as for the speech case as being kind of a generalization of spectral subtraction in a way.,S
824,this is sort of adjusting it for for a lot of different levels.,S
856,huh.,S
873,in principle.,S
895,the uh stuff at the harmonics isn't so much.,S
897,and there's this overall idea of really sort of matching the the distributions somehow.,S
900,not just subtracting off your estimate of the noise.,S
902,so i guess uh guenter's going to play around with some of these things now over this next period.,S
905,i don't have feedback from him.,S
907,yeah.,S
916,we could put it in.,S
921,that's good.,S
925,not not so much in this meeting about aurora.,S
927,uh maybe just uh quickly today about maybe you could just say a little bit about what you've been talking about with michael.,S
929,and then barry can say something about what what we're talking about.,S
940,he he's coming here to use it on uh a real speech recognition system.,S
943,maybe i should say a little more about these features.,S
973,he and then he uses that to classify.,S
1009,i would agree that the second one is is somewhat more different.,S
1025,but it's also uh,D
1048,here at least you're starting off with all of them.,S
1053,so the only thing is of course there's this this artificial question of of uh exactly how you how you how you assess it.,S
1060,the thing that i wanted to to add to it also was to have us use this in a multi stream way.,S
1063,so so that um when you come up with these different things and these different functions you don't necessarily just put them all into one huge vector.,S
1066,and we've also talked a little bit about uh uh shihab shamma's stuff.,S
1072,so there's a bunch of stuff to look at.,S
1077,he'll be another interesting source of wisdom.,S
1080,as as we were talking about this i was thinking um whether there's a relationship between um between michael's approach to uh some some sort of optimal brain damage or optimal brain surgeon on the neural nets.,S
1085,we have our we have our rasta features and,D
1115,uh i i know that sometimes it's useful to to constrain things.,S
1120,yeah well if we had infinite processing power and data i guess using the waveform could,D
1124,then it would work.,S
1132,uhhuh.,B
1144,so maybe just briefly uh,D
1155,um at the end of the day you have this neural net.,S
1177,yeah so so that's the that's the first part uh one one of the ideas to get at some some patterns of intermediate categories.,S
1183,i guess that's that's it.,S
1,uh,F
2,okay so there is kind of summary of what has been done.,S
28,yeah yeah.,S
33,but actually um for english training on timit is still better than the other languages.,S
36,yeah.,B
50,yeah.,B
61,yeah um so the second point is that we have no single cross language experiments uh that we did not have last week.,S
72,yeah.,F
73,what we see is that these nets are not as good.,S
76,then we started to work on a large database containing uh sentences from the french from the spanish from the timit from spine uh from uh english digits and from italian digits.,D
90,uh yeah.,B
103,yeah.,F
104,huh.,D
119,okay.,S
138,i don't know what exactly.,S
167,this,D
184,fifty two per cent.,S
196,so,F
197,oh this is accuracy!,S
229,um well but that's yeah that's without the neural net.,S
267,whatever the normalization actually.,S
271,well ninety,D
285,all right.,B
289,yeah.,B
294,and the multi english does.,S
296,so if we think of this in error rates we start off with uh eighteen per cent error rate roughly.,S
343,well stephane was saying that they weren't hand labeled.,S
357,huh with the experiment type two.,S
374,actually just to be some more,D
386,so,F
387,yeah but i mean in this case for the eighty seven point one we used m l p outputs for the p l p net.,S
402,this is not perhaps not clear here.,S
407,yeah,F
408,so actually it it it decreased the the accuracy.,S
410,yeah.,B
478,yeah.,S
488,because in this situation we have one hundred and three feature.,S
520,yeah.,B
526,maybe you don't.,S
528,yeah you have to change the,D
555,yeah.,B
558,so it could just be that treating them equally treating two streams equally is just just not the right thing to do.,S
563,okay.,S
568,yeah try all these different tests.,S
574,so the next point.,S
576,we've had some discussion with steve and shawn.,S
579,so we'll perhaps start something next week.,S
582,uh where to plug in the the network uh after the the feature.,S
586,actually hynek would like to see,D
595,and about multi band.,S
598,actually i i prefer to do exactly what i did when i was in belgium.,S
605,i'm starting to train also networks with larger contexts.,S
610,yeah.,F
611,we still have to work on finnish.,S
624,the number of frames is bad also.,S
629,yeah as we mentioned timit is the only that's hand labeled.,S
632,yeah the other are just viterbi aligned.,S
638,with respect to the features.,S
658,yeah basically the observation is what we discussed already.,S
661,the fact that the m l p trained on target task decreased the error rate.,S
694,yeah my but i don't know.,S
701,yeah.,S
705,yeah.,B
709,yeah but,D
751,yeah that's pretty much what we've seen.,S
763,yeah so the the reason yeah the reason is that perhaps the target the task dependency the language dependency and the noise dependency,D
769,i i i don't think we have enough result to talk about the the language dependency.,S
779,summary of the first uh uh forty five minutes is that some stuff work and works and some stuff doesn't.,S
790,okay.,F
791,so you're saying that um um although from what we see,D
806,yeah.,B
811,i don't i don't know.,S
829,aha!,S
837,um,F
838,yeah so this is not really the viterbi alignment.,S
845,i thought some of the nets were trained with spine and so forth.,S
850,but,D
852,results are only coming for for this net.,S
857,so uh from these results we have some questions with answers.,S
861,but it seems important to use the delta.,S
867,still no answer actually.,S
890,uhhuh.,B
909,for moment you use we use phonetic targets.,S
915,uhhuh.,B
923,yeah that seems like a good thing to do probably.,S
925,not uh again a short term sort of thing.,S
948,but then which is um copied over many times with a range of different noises.,S
953,yeah okay.,S
955,um yeah.,F
956,the future work is well try to connect to the to make to plug in the system to the o g i.,S
962,and i guess you know the the the real open question,D
971,and,D
1003,yeah so this would be more working on the m l p as an additional path instead of an insert to the to their diagram.,S
1011,but on the other hand they did it before.,S
1016,yeah.,F
1017,and because also perhaps we know that the when we have very good features the m l p doesn't help.,S
1021,so uh we we want to get their path running here.,S
1025,as an additional path.,S
1042,so,D
1059,just for the testing just make sure that we get the same results so we can duplicate it before we add in another,D
1066,yeah so lograsta,D
1133,yeah.,D
1137,huh.,B
1156,and c p u memory issues.,S
1180,um well i don't think we're um completely off the wall.,S
1185,i mean we may find that we we're not really going to worry about the m l p.,S
1193,we do the other manipulations that we're doing before that.,S
1196,so i think the key thing was um this plug into o g i.,S
1198,what what are they what are they going to be working,D
1202,so um,F
1203,this that was pratibha.,S
1224,so i guess the way it would work is that you'd get,D
1252,i i don't know.,S
1262,yeah perhaps we could.,S
1273,yeah i think for right now um i i i really liked m s g.,S
1277,we only have limited time.,S
1287,huh.,B
1290,and then you know once we,D
1298,huh.,B
1308,yeah right now i'm i'm focusing mainly on this final project i'm working on in jordan's class.,S
1323,oh.,S
1341,i think so yeah.,S
1360,if people are interested in in getting jobs running on that maybe i could help with that.,S
1365,yeah we,D
1371,but,F
1372,yeah.,B
1379,i don't think we have to train a lot of networks now that we know.,S
1388,it's okay yeah.,S
1398,all right.,S
1404,i think i won't touch anything.,S
1410,connect the,D
7,okay,F
8,okay so um,F
9,you collected an agenda huh?,S
38,so you think two you think two hours is the is the total that we have.,S
81,you want different prosodics.,S
93,maybe some but probably not so much.,S
113,and it seems like that might be better for you guys.,S
136,but it's nice to get it in this room with the,D
147,we can go back to the other thing later.,S
231,right.,S
253,but the other differences are so major.,S
284,and they're different circumstances with different recording environment and so forth.,S
308,i purposely didn't want them to look like they were in any kind of pattern.,S
311,and which group appears is picked randomly and what the numbers are are picked randomly.,S
325,yeah.,S
345,so those speakers who are very quiet shy,D
372,the only thing that we don't have,D
411,anyway it's just a thought.,S
425,okay.,S
472,huh.,D
483,can try it out.,S
508,uh,F
509,nein!,S
525,i think everybody's a little punchy here today.,S
533,and but you know if it were to be deflated just the normal word it would be like a little story that we could read.,S
554,we have a.s.r. results from liz.,S
599,but as we i mean i wanted to here more about the transcription.,S
639,for you it was,D
669,like a eurospeech paper.,S
672,so the idea is that you would take this big hunk where somebody's only speaking a small amount in it.,S
679,yeah should it,D
692,yeah.,B
699,but,F
700,yeah.,B
721,so we'll be,D
737,okay.,S
782,no it's it's,D
790,right.,B
797,terrific.,S
799,all right.,S
813,okay.,S
817,which is,D
822,that's typical huh.,S
825,it's local though.,S
827,that doesn't matter.,S
850,the stuff that isn't backed up is not a big deal.,S
874,it just depends on your tools.,S
882,yeah.,S
889,so that's,D
891,yeah if,D
908,yeah.,B
917,as yeah as long as there is a a form that we can come from again that is not downsampled then,D
924,because we're basically duplicating the originals um,D
965,this is an hour of speech.,S
980,otherwise you're just accessing,D
992,yeah and they don't.,S
1050,but i think it's more efficient if we have the storage space to have the small ones.,S
1075,each partition.,S
1098,i did a bunch of checks.,S
1318,we uh reconstructed how that happened.,S
1385,well or if you're a c. programmer.,S
1405,i have one question about the the e.h. versus like the a.h. and the u.h.,S
1443,yeah.,B
1457,no only if you don't have lax vowels i guess.,S
1465,uhhuh.,B
1475,any case that's the this is reduced down from really quite a a much longer list.,S
1575,that's interesting.,S
1602,uh to me that sounds equivalent.,S
1614,the self-referential aspect of these these,D
1655,i actually explicitly looked for that one.,S
1677,that's funny.,S
1694,oh oh.,S
1727,yeah.,B
1790,yeah.,B
1798,uh that's what gets i i picked those up in the frequency check.,S
1856,right thanks.,S
1911,chuck pointed out that this is read speech.,S
1985,good.,S
2012,okay.,B
2031,as long as they're as they're different strings that we that'll make our sort of processing more robust.,S
2052,yeah and it makes it i guess the thing about,D
2059,so,F
2060,and increase the size of the files and the and decrease the readability to such an extent by simply something like percent.,S
2074,uh,F
2075,huh.,B
2107,yeah i i like the idea of having this in there.,S
2149,so this is going to be useful to expand this.,S
2197,no but i mean my question is like should i wait until all of those are processed and channelized?,S
2205,okay.,S
2220,so right now the what you're doing is you're taking the uh the original version.,S
2230,and so it's a question of like what,D
2241,yeah i mean,D
2243,yeah.,B
2274,so yeah.,F
2275,as long as we're at that point.,S
2279,okay.,S
10,uh in a in a smaller group we had uh talked and decided about continuation of the data collection.,S
22,we want to design it so that they really have to think about having some time.,S
26,um sort of package the whole thing in a in a in a few more complicated um structure.,S
32,should be means they aren't yet.,S
42,the uh,D
46,something happened in on eva's side with the p r m that we're going to look at today.,S
48,we have a visitor from bruchsal from the international university.,S
51,yeah.,S
55,so when you said andreas i thought you were talking about stolcke.,S
72,the,D
82,yeah sure.,S
88,um,F
89,i've been looking at the p r m stuff.,S
91,so this is sort of like the latest thing i have on it.,S
93,i sort of constructed a couple of classes.,S
99,so basically i took out a lot of stuff a lot of the decision nodes.,S
106,this is more or less similar to the flat bayes net that i have you know with the input nodes and all that.,S
108,so i tried to construct the dependency models.,S
110,a lot of these stuff i got from the flat bayes net.,S
131,for each of the site you'll come up with this rating of travel compatibility.,S
136,i guess you end up having fewer number of nodes than in a flat bayes net.,S
140,no you would definitely have,D
146,you know in the case where it depends on both the user and the site then i'm still having a hard time trying to see how um using the p r m will help.,S
166,so instead of um doing a lot of you know computation about you know which one site it wants of the user wants to visit i'll come well try to come up with like sort of a list of sites.,S
175,so,F
179,okay.,S
186,the people at stanford write papers as if they had one.,S
205,i don't know.,S
216,the um,D
221,because um,D
249,more uncertainty or or,D
251,i remember them learning when you know you don't know the structure for sure.,S
260,yeah.,B
265,yep.,S
280,until then we'll come up with a something that's that's way more complicated for you.,S
289,you could from this go on and say suppose there's a group of people traveling together.,S
314,so so there there are some some uh you know uh elaborations of this.,S
320,it's good yeah.,S
336,and then and ask some some questions uh in a couple days.,S
340,um uh what's uh sort of the state of the art there is to um uh you have a bunch of of uh documents or learning units or learning objects.,S
353,i think that's a that's a very that's a key point of these systems.,S
374,and i think that i don't need to tell you this.,S
384,um,F
385,basically giving this um uh,D
414,what i'm also looking into is a probabilistic approach into this.,S
430,okay.,S
463,right.,S
489,huh,B
531,yeah.,F
532,the idea was there yeah okay.,S
537,yeah actually you guys never,D
551,and i we you know it's fine we don't care.,S
561,no no there was a whole there was a little contract signed.,S
570,right.,B
579,right.,B
588,yeah for for some reason he's not doing that.,S
608,and he just finished writing a draft of his thesis.,S
617,okay great.,S
627,wait a second.,S
632,so i did some double checking.,S
651,yesterday day there was this uh uh i thought that the other branch would just approve it.,S
655,oh i have to tell you a wonderful story about this.,S
690,you know again if if you if you,D
693,and this was this was literacy.,S
706,enormous problem in california.,S
712,um,F
713,i know none of us have the spare time to look at it right now.,S
1,so then let's start with our weekly meeting.,S
4,uh today i have two topics.,S
37,i've in the study for some time these kind of networks.,S
40,for example routing on on wired networks is a a topic still to be researched.,S
53,well i'm i'm a computer guy.,S
58,this is i think um my first presentation.,S
70,one short other topic is uh claudia did a lot of work concerning the web pages in the meantime.,S
80,let's switch to the project proposal.,S
83,sorry.,S
97,then maybe you can easy offer some additional input which should be presented then on the web pages.,S
102,about the projects will be something.,S
113,yeah you can have it.,S
124,but what i can,D
127,yeah but but what is planned is that i do something like previous you know layout and give everybody the uh uh the possibility to the chance to put his content inside.,S
143,let's switch to the proposal.,S
152,from my point of view as i mentioned before we still in the starting position.,S
202,yeah and this probably has to be a brainstorm right now.,S
263,if connection is lost i am i'm not sure if sometimes you'd simply have to drop a connection if you have outstanding connections.,S
276,uh,F
285,this can be something that probably the user wants to be aware of.,S
317,well the switching itself could be a problem.,S
334,it's only to set up,D
362,uh,F
363,if if you can leave it out the network that will be really cool.,S
366,yes.,F
367,but when quality of service comes to the uh scene well i think we have a a bigger problem.,S
372,now i would like not to hear only three opinions.,S
394,it can be done.,S
420,okay.,S
430,so we,D
445,uh,F
466,well what this video was presenting was a kind of test of of one guy with a portable computer moving across different networks.,S
495,okay.,S
527,it's funny.,S
538,yeah.,B
543,that's right.,S
547,uhhuh.,S
558,uh thomas is going to build mobile i.p. stuff in their servers.,S
560,because they want to,D
563,and my third uh comment is uh if we are going something in that direction that is quite different from this thing here.,S
573,yeah.,S
607,yeah what is what means quality of service.,S
612,sometimes we have some,D
616,because g.s.m. networks were developed to uh with a voice service in mind.,S
619,uh in fact for every voice channel you have uh a pretty fine maximum uh delay and jitter and a a a specified um data speed.,S
636,that is,D
639,i mean uh i don't see that a a lot of difference.,S
646,no i think there's a lot.,S
649,i think there's a lot of research.,S
682,the i believe there is a lot of research work.,S
693,there's a lot of potential as i believe for for uh certain research work.,S
715,nobody really wants a a guest on your network.,S
729,what they do right now is they make it part of the application level protocol.,S
822,and,F
823,um,D
836,and the the um,F
837,um now how to say the requirements of this application using this classroom scenario.,S
840,networking stuff.,S
871,k.p.n. interests.,S
885,i have a an important doubt about the i.p. availability over u.m.t.s.,S
905,let alone u.m.t.s.,S
913,uh i never was a friend,D
944,anyway you have the gateway.,S
958,right now there is still a lot of wap actually.,S
966,well users usage.,S
976,i don't have a mobile phone.,S
1002,but and but i'm i just wanted to say it is being used.,S
1036,uhhuh.,B
1056,now we are talking about something which is much more precise.,S
1081,and then you are still at the triple a. service uh activity.,S
1128,yeah the problem is if you,D
1286,i want to have really the activities.,S
1317,in in the better case maybe i'm only able to add two different networks to this thing.,S
1319,the difficulty i see is that uh if we are if you want to think in in two three four different technologies um maybe we are uh too advanced too um let's say uh too in advance for the current technology.,S
1326,i'm still trying to you know to get used to the uh all the ideas.,S
1336,it's clear.,S
1356,um,F
1357,but then to go for instance to u.m.t.s. and figure out what is available within u.m.t.s.,S
1398,and after this theoretical framework if this one is aligned okay you have some specification.,S
1443,and if we have other suggestions and uh have this as a long term,D
1449,and and have an intermediate project which is related in this direction something like the seamless handover for two technologies or whatever.,S
1470,yeah.,B
1475,so that's uh to open my mind.,S
1483,and when you when you will go back to spain right?,S
1499,probably.,S
1623,so you what you might want to do is well get u.m.t.s. out there.,S
1642,well that's my final vision you know.,S
1647,uh but is far far away you know.,S
1658,yeah but maybe in the lan interface it makes.,S
1672,um we didn't make much progress today in the meeting.,S
1717,now let me see whether he will be here.,S
1719,we did not forget.,S
6,that was programmed for yesterday i guess.,S
8,yesterday.,S
10,yesterday morning on video conference.,S
12,well,F
13,oh.,S
29,uh,F
30,so,F
31,i mean let's let's assume for right now that we're just kind of plugging on ahead.,S
39,we took first we took the l d a filters.,S
49,oh okay.,S
73,no i mean because the the the the whole problem that happened before was coordination.,S
81,i,D
90,yeah.,S
93,i mean,F
94,um,F
95,we just we just have to be in contact more.,S
99,okay.,B
102,yeah.,S
105,right.,S
111,and so yeah for the delay i gave you here it's it's uh computed on the five hertz modulation frequency.,S
114,uh,F
115,this is the first thing.,S
126,which will perhaps add some more delay.,S
131,so we will try also to add a nice downsampling.,S
139,and so yeah.,F
140,this will be another filter which would add ten milliseconds again.,S
143,yeah.,S
150,and when we look at this filter actually it has a delay of eighty five milliseconds.,S
157,huh!,S
161,but well when we add up everything it's it will be all right.,S
167,yeah but then there's,D
172,just just barely in there.,S
186,huh.,B
190,uh.,S
192,you know it's,D
194,and basically the best proposal had something like thirty or forty milliseconds of latency.,S
197,well.,F
198,yeah.,S
201,they were more or less trading computation for performance.,S
224,the uh spectral subtraction schemes a couple places did seem seem to do a nice job.,S
226,uh,F
227,we're talking about putting putting some of that in while still keeping some of our stuff.,S
238,and i don't think anybody's going to notice the difference between a quarter of a second of latency and thirty milliseconds of latency.,S
244,we would look for the end of an utterance based on the silence detector.,S
250,but it was,D
252,i would say it was probably around the order of two hundred and fifty milliseconds.,S
265,so you you so you had a,D
272,right.,B
283,yeah.,B
304,because when we talk to each other we tend to step on each other's utterances.,S
312,i mean i think,D
331,i mean you could do this with a recurrent net.,S
340,we've always had usually we used the symmetric windows.,S
342,yeah.,S
348,so that's what that's what you're busy with.,S
352,and uh,F
353,also we were thinking to to uh apply the uh spectral subtraction from ericsson.,S
372,uh huh.,B
374,uh,F
377,well it's that by for the moment we have uh something that's discriminant and nonlinear.,S
381,so at least just to understand maybe what the difference was between how much you were getting from just putting the frames together and how much you're getting from the discriminative.,S
386,uh,F
387,yeah.,F
388,actually what we want to do perhaps it's to replace to to have something that's discriminant but linear also.,S
393,yeah well that's what i meant is to see whether whether it having the neural net really buys you anything.,S
395,huh.,B
412,so it would be on the,D
414,we was,D
417,yeah.,S
426,before after v a d.,S
441,the argument was let's not have that be part of this test.,S
452,yeah so there's the question of the v a d.,S
471,i mean if you look at the theory it's it should be in the power domain.,S
479,yeah.,B
481,and there's this,D
489,or or less.,S
496,and generated this this,D
498,um,F
499,so you have the estimation of the power spectra of the noise.,S
503,huh!,S
508,oh!,S
515,huh!,S
562,so this gives you what the signal is and what the noise energy is in that band in the spectrum.,S
570,but,D
587,not necessarily.,S
596,if you,D
602,yeah but it,D
607,not at the end.,S
609,uhhuh.,B
619,yeah.,B
621,well the thing,D
629,it has to work.,S
638,uhhuh.,B
656,so in this case yeah sure you cannot,D
660,well five hundred was not so bad.,S
662,and he worked on non stationary noises.,S
665,things like that.,S
667,were his uh windows centered around the,D
669,um,F
670,yeah.,S
672,i think,D
680,no i understand it's better to do.,S
689,huh.,B
691,but i don't know if you know if sinusoidally uh amplitude modulated noise is is sort of a big problem in in in practice.,S
698,what,D
707,oh yeah.,S
714,a dictionary.,S
738,i don't know.,S
745,uh we'll have to figure ways without it.,S
759,so,F
760,yeah.,F
761,i think yeah i think ericsson used this kind of threshold yeah.,S
765,what's under this threshold is used to update the estimate.,S
776,huh.,B
785,okay.,S
788,let's see.,S
796,two three.,S
799,yeah.,S
807,they're they're taking sub band features and um training up a detector that detects for um these phonetic features.,S
817,the higher level there's a soft or gate.,S
824,and,D
826,the one,D
839,yeah.,F
840,so i was using e m to get the targets.,S
850,then he has each of these and things.,S
852,um,F
853,but,D
856,and um,F
857,they have to have targets.,S
875,okay.,S
878,and for for every every sub band you you just pick ahead of time um i'm going to have like five independent logistic tests.,S
885,and he shows that using this this method to detect sonorance is it's very robust compared to um to typical uh full band gaussian mixtures um estimations of of sonorance.,S
889,so,F
890,so that's just that's just one detector.,S
908,uh the third thing i like about it is,D
918,along the way how much should we uh,D
933,i i think it's very hard for someone to to a person to make that determination.,S
935,um we don't really know how those should be labeled.,S
971,so it's,D
976,um,F
977,so um,F
978,if you knew you were doing that,D
983,so i think that the questioner was right.,S
1002,yeah.,F
1003,huh.,B
1006,in addition to detecting sonorants.,S
1008,um,F
1016,uh let's see.,S
1018,yeah.,S
1021,um,F
1022,i mean easiest thing would be to go go do some voicing stuff.,S
1026,when we when we talked with john ohala the other day we made a list of some of the things that,D
1037,so there's a half dozen like that that are,D
1039,yeah.,S
1051,there's also things like stress.,S
1069,oh i see what you're saying.,S
1076,right.,B
1088,we don't understand anything in this meeting.,S
1092,that's you know a neat neat thing.,S
1097,uh,F
1098,well i don't know.,S
1102,huh.,B
1105,huh.,B
1112,and we'll we'll end up doing some i think.,S
1118,yeah i think it's an interesting interesting way to go.,S
1121,i say it like said int i think it has a number of good things.,S
1127,we're interested in um methods for far mike speech recognition.,S
1130,one approach would be um say m s g and p l p like was used in aurora one.,S
1142,there was something that was done by um a guy named carlos i forget his last name who worked with hynek who um,D
1146,yeah.,B
1158,then there are a couple of other speech enhancement approaches which haven't been tried for speech recognition yet.,S
1169,we have uh,D
1186,i i guess i guess when people are working with single microphones they are more trying to do,D
1194,not in the time domain.,S
1201,we should try to,D
1207,the first paper on this is going to have great references.,S
1215,well he did echo cancellation.,S
1220,yeah.,B
1250,uh,F
1251,so,F
1252,anyway.,F
1253,uh i think that's that's all we have this week.,S
1256,and uh i think it's digit time.,S
1276,but,D
1282,i didn't notice this.,S
1,so um,F
2,i was going to try to get out of here like in half an hour.,S
4,because i really appreciate people coming.,S
14,which,D
21,i actually mostly need to be able to link up or,D
23,it's it's a question both of what the representation is and,D
38,so that you start with with a timeline tag.,S
50,and then i i also had optional things like accuracy.,S
93,you know so you could have some sort of type here.,S
96,the utterance that it's referring to could be u. seventeen or something like that.,S
99,i mean that seems that seems great for all of the encoding of things with time.,S
101,oh well.,S
110,because you could you could all you'd have to change is the um time stamps in the timeline without without uh changing the i.d.'s.,S
126,i think for phone level you want to use some sort of binary representation.,S
145,because it does get very with,D
150,i'm just,D
172,that you could call that you would tie into this representation with like an i.d.,S
177,okay.,S
180,so that external file wouldn't be in,D
191,anything at frame level you had better encode binary.,S
196,you can always uh g. zip them.,S
216,or something like that.,S
219,you know people don't,D
235,so i think it it's debatable whether you want to do phone level in the same thing.,S
240,i would use something tighter than p. files.,S
243,i haven't seen this particular format.,S
246,i don't know what their structure is.,S
266,the only problem with it is it's actually storing the utterance numbers and the frame numbers in the file.,S
281,i mean that sounds good.,S
290,but it's been used here.,S
302,but,F
303,yeah so there is something like that.,S
319,they generate their own.,S
338,so it's doable.,S
357,it doesn't have to be pretty.,S
366,i mean i'm not sure what to do about this with atlas.,S
383,i mean you could sort of,D
391,so,F
392,well the other thing is if we choose to use atlas which maybe we should just do we should just throw this out before we invest a lot of time in it.,S
425,end equals some other node i.d.,S
434,but it but that sounds,D
469,if,D
479,so it's,F
480,that that would really be the question is just what you would feel is in the long run the best thing.,S
482,right.,S
487,the other thing the other way that i sort of established this was as easy translation to and from the transcriber format.,S
490,right.,S
492,i mean i like this.,S
497,i suppose that as long as they have a type here that specifies utt,D
499,it's almost the same.,S
508,well if you look at it,D
510,i guess in my mind i don't know enough jane would know better about the types of annotations.,S
518,and then from the recognition side we have backtraces at the phone level.,S
528,it seems to me you want to keep the frame level stuff separate.,S
553,and so so this one would have um an i.d. is link link seventy four or something like that.,S
559,or something like that.,S
582,right.,S
586,i mean i assume this is possible that if you have someone annotates the punctuation or whatever when they transcribe you can say you know from for from the beginning of the sentence to the end of the sentence from the annotations this is a unit.,S
596,but it's just not overtly in the,D
601,i think that should be possible as long as the,D
618,see because it's,D
630,the thing is that something may be a part of one thing for one purpose and another thing of another purpose.,S
635,well.,F
636,well i think i'm i think i had better look at it again.,S
641,because i i'm,D
660,yeah.,B
688,that's good.,S
691,uh and i mean you guys might,D
697,i mean yeah you sure you can do it.,S
704,you got to you got to do this you you're going to want to do this very quickly.,S
706,or else you'll spend all your time sort of searching through very complex data structures.,S
719,i mean that's going to be hard regardless.,S
725,right.,S
739,you want sort of a grep that's that works at the structural on the structural representation.,S
760,that's different from searching through the text.,S
763,no no no.,S
767,so that,D
786,i guess that one's actually easier.,S
792,you you could use the x.m.l. to put the data in.,S
799,one of the things that atlas is doing is they're trying to define an a.p.i. which is independent of the back store.,S
815,because it's a big learning curve just to get going.,S
858,you know we'll do something where we some kind of data reduction where the prosodic features are sort uh either at the word level or at the segment level.,S
877,right.,B
888,if if you would look at that and let us know what you think,D
896,well i wouldn't wait for the formats because anything you pick we'll be able to translate to another form.,S
898,okay.,S
903,yeah definitely.,S
915,um,F
916,so maybe if you guys can look at it and sort of see what,D
920,i think we're we're we're actually just,D
926,um,F
927,yeah.,S
930,well i don't know.,S
936,i mean the reason i like p. file is i'm already familiar with it.,S
946,there used to be a problem that they get too large.,S
964,so i guess,D
1007,well that's really useful.,S
1010,so,F
1011,yeah i've been meaning to look at the atlas stuff again anyway.,S
1039,easy easy to map.,S
1058,um,F
1059,if we if we tie the overlap code to the first word in the overlap then you'll have a time marking.,S
1064,also you could have different time bins for different purposes.,S
1074,well overlap codes.,S
1088,and and and let's say that this is a time bin.,S
1093,then you can indicate that this here was perhaps a a backchannel.,S
1104,it would be nice,D
1106,uh this is sort of regarding uh uh it's related but not directly germane to the topic of discussion.,S
1114,there's a zillion things that people might annotate this for.,S
1122,you'd it's much more efficient for them to just see the word sequence right?,S
1126,so the the the point is,D
1130,um,F
1131,the my point is that you're going to end up with uh word sequences that are differently annotated.,S
1137,well all the switchboard in it.,S
1165,you could definitely do that with the,D
1180,but this is exactly what i mean is that that the problem,D
1191,so so just to let you know what we where we kluged it by uh doing uh by doing hhh,D
1205,so,F
1206,yep.,B
1209,it it was a kluge.,S
1213,so,F
1214,but,F
1215,isn't that something where whoever if if the people who are making changes say in the transcripts because this all happened when the transcripts were different um if they tie it to something like if they tied it to the acoustic segment if they,D
1226,because if the data gets out people will do all kinds of things to it.,S
1248,you were saying that you didn't think we should,D
1257,so so imagine,D
1277,but you'd have some anchoring point.,S
1305,uhhuh.,B
1320,well i guess i i didn't want to keep people too long.,S
1326,uh well.,S
1332,thanks thanks a lot.,S
47,um,F
48,well this past week i've just been uh getting down and dirty into writing my my proposal.,S
50,um,F
51,huh.,F
52,i just finished a section on uh on talking about these intermediate categories that i want to classify um as a as a middle step.,S
54,i hope to hope to get this um a full rough draft done by uh monday so i can give it to morgan.,S
77,and then um then everybody asks you questions.,S
82,so um,F
96,i think one of the perplexing problems is,D
98,for a while i was thinking that i had to come up with a complete set of intermediate features intermediate categories to to classify right away.,S
118,um,F
119,then,D
131,and then do the same process there um on on a large vocabulary task like switchboard.,S
133,and for that,D
143,and,F
144,i guess that's that's it.,S
161,last week i finally got results from the s r i system about this mean subtraction approach.,S
169,uh with some input from uh andreas i have a theory in two parts.,S
171,first of all h t k sorry s the s r i system is doing channel adaptation.,S
174,so this,D
176,this mean subtraction approach will do a kind of channel normalization.,S
182,and me and barry were listening to the re synthesized audio.,S
187,i'm going to try training on a larger data set.,S
191,huh,F
192,i had another thought just now.,S
196,uh,F
197,if you,D
212,um,F
213,what if you did,D
222,uh i'm just saying if in fact it turns out that that these echoes that you're hearing are uh,D
236,yeah.,S
244,so it's these are just microphone,D
255,okay.,S
258,but the other thing is he's putting in,D
287,so if what you're doing is improving the signal to noise ratio then it would be better.,S
324,huh.,B
326,if it's if it's like if it's trying to find a a reverberation filter it could be that this reverberation filter is making things quieter.,S
329,uh no.,S
344,oh okay.,S
346,i wonder if there could be something like uh for for the p z m data.,S
349,i'm just wondering if there's something about the um you know doing the mean normalization where uh it it could cause you to have better signal to noise ratio.,S
351,well you know there is this.,S
377,i think so.,S
386,all that stuff.,S
397,i i've just been testing the new aurora front end with well aurora system actually.,S
403,oh that's a lot better.,S
418,we have the new l d a filters.,S
420,i think maybe i didn't look but one thing that makes a difference is this d c offset compensation.,S
450,uhhuh.,B
452,no it's the electronics.,S
476,so i i came up with a web page that people can take a look at.,S
478,the interesting thing that i tried was um adam and morgan had this idea.,S
482,um,F
483,there's reason to believe that that approach of taking the mean of the phase spectrum wasn't really mathematically correct.,S
517,um,F
518,yeah so i think i will maybe train like gender dependent models.,S
521,the other differences were the fact that maybe the acoustic models of the s r i are more s r i system are more complex.,S
524,it didn't seem to help in the h t k system.,S
527,well it sounds like they also have,D
540,i'm not sure how they would do it when they're working with the digits.,S
556,nnn.,B
571,uhhuh.,B
583,yeah.,F
584,well.,F
585,um,F
586,well the first thing i that i want to do is just maybe these gender things.,S
588,and maybe see with andreas if,D
603,you know the the aurora baseline is set up with these um this version of the clean training set that's been filtered with this g seven one two filter.,S
605,um to train the s r i system on digits s andreas used the original t i digits.,S
640,okay.,S
655,so,F
656,so,F
657,yeah.,F
658,the only difference is the features right now.,S
671,yeah.,F
672,and another thing i i maybe would like to do is to just test the s r i system that's trained on macrophone.,S
682,uh,F
683,you know it would also be interesting to see uh to do the regular aurora test.,S
685,but use the s r i system instead of h t k.,S
693,yeah there is this problem of multilinguality yet.,S
711,uh,F
712,i guess the work would be into getting the the files in the right formats or something.,S
715,uhhuh.,B
741,uhhuh.,F
742,uh yeah.,S
746,um,F
747,so i'm just talking about the the curves that i i sent i sent you.,S
756,uh,F
757,well.,F
758,first of all the boundaries might be uh like we would have two hundred milliseconds or before and after speech.,S
760,so removing more than that might still make a difference in the results.,S
768,oh yeah.,S
770,yeah.,F
771,but maybe we'll get some insight on that when when uh the gang gets back from crete.,S
780,but i don't know.,F
781,because we were wondering whether that v a d is going to be like a realistic one or is it going to be some manual segmentation.,S
796,there's an uh i think it's still for even for the evaluation.,S
800,um,F
801,with some some gap.,S
803,i mean with some pauses in the center.,S
812,yeah.,B
815,although that'd be hard.,S
819,yeah.,B
825,yeah.,F
826,so i did i just started to test putting together two v a d which was was not much work actually.,S
828,i re implemented a v a d that's very close to the um energy based v a d that uh the other aurora guys use.,S
830,so which is just putting a threshold on the noise energy.,S
834,uh,F
835,from this point uh tagging the frames there as speech.,S
839,still on the noises where our m l p v a d doesn't work a lot.,S
842,and,D
845,uh,F
846,you know in the old days people would use energy.,S
852,yeah.,B
857,just as a gross generalization most many nonspeech noises have a low pass kind of characteristic.,S
879,it it might be that what i did is,D
884,i only keep the frames where the two agree that it's speech.,S
891,one could imagine combining them in different ways.,S
893,i guess what you're saying is that the the m l p based one has the spectral information.,S
896,but,F
897,yeah.,S
900,well you can imagine,D
909,but,D
939,uh the second thing is the this spectral subtraction.,S
941,um,F
942,which i've just started yesterday to launch a bunch of uh twenty five experiments.,S
945,it's the makhoul type spectral subtraction which use an over estimation factor.,S
957,well it depends on the parameters that you use.,S
960,on the other hand when you subtract more and when you add more noise you get rid of this musical noise.,S
963,well.,F
964,huh,F
965,well it until now it doesn't seem to help.,S
972,can smooth the s n r estimate also.,S
976,your filter is a function of s n r huh?,S
985,uh,F
986,i don't know.,S
997,i've been playing with this wiener filter like.,S
1046,and the other thing that i tried was but i just took of those uh carlos filters which hynek had.,S
1054,so,F
1055,yeah just just to see whether it really it's it's is it worth trying or not.,S
1061,and where if he has any filters which are derived on o g i stories added with some type of noise which what we are using currently.,S
1074,it actually uh enhances the onset and offset of i mean the the begin and the end of the speech.,S
1084,that's something i observe using that filter.,S
1086,yeah.,F
1087,there are a few,D
1093,i'll i'll continue with that for some,D
1097,yeah.,S
1105,you know things.,S
1117,well thinking about that we we then we decide that maybe is a good idea.,S
1126,not,D
1131,uh,F
1132,you could do some normalization uh before the v t s.,S
1135,but but c zero certainly acts differently than the others do.,S
1137,so that's,D
1141,well i am working in that now.,S
1145,it's it's,D
1159,uh maybe we could call someone else up who has.,S
1162,uhhuh.,B
1165,pratibha.,S
1170,so i expect it if if you have something that's independent of this i expect it to it to uh be a better model of speech.,S
1173,well.,F
1174,you you wouldn't even need to switch to cepstra.,S
1188,not of noise.,S
1193,we,D
1202,i am thinking about that and working about that.,S
1214,okay.,S
39,okay.,S
55,so that's as far as our brainstorming was concerned.,S
58,but i i will just make a first draft of the uh note.,S
72,n. .,D
77,they have the right,D
79,the last paragraph if you agree to participate you have the opportunity to have anything excised which you would prefer not to have included in the data set.,S
89,yep makes sense.,S
93,jane may say that you know you can't do this.,S
101,and so forth.,S
111,they're they all seem to be happy now with that.,S
117,bhaskara and i started working on the the parser.,S
120,it uh i didn't measure it.,S
167,yeah we we can uh i can show you the templates.,S
174,well that sounds,D
201,uhhuh.,D
224,right.,B
228,oh this are the reserve.,S
230,um these are the sort of the ten different sentence types that the uh the parser was able to do.,S
235,sorry.,S
237,you have already to make it a little bit more elaborate right?,S
245,and this is what i had to do.,S
335,so that's,D
345,it has these style sheets and also the um schemata.,S
353,where is the uh,D
366,this is sort of what happens.,S
371,i saw those actions uh the goodbye stuff somewhere.,S
387,so whenever it it encounters goodbye,S
458,well it just automatically initializes things that are common right?,S
481,and that whatever is being changed has something to do with the cinema.,S
496,sort of get a complete understanding of the whole thing.,D
505,huh.,S
516,also not very interesting.,S
524,i asked them whether or not we could um,D
544,and uh,F
545,however the uh so that you understand it is really simple.,S
558,and also um since you had suggested that that um we figure out if we ever for a demo reason wanted to shortcut directly to the g.i.s. and the planner,D
568,so well let now this is important.,S
571,you're in the midst of this.,S
608,so yeah.,F
609,the problem isn't the short range optimization.,S
631,huh.,B
635,then then,D
642,then the scope of this is beyond approach and or vista.,S
682,i'd be i'd be surprised at,D
685,i mean if if you want to uh push us into reference problems that would be great.,S
781,i don't know.,S
801,and sort of we don't know how to handle them too.,S
808,ooo.,D
827,is is in this sort of over-arching story we we worked it out for as you say this the storytelling scenario.,S
868,you might yeah.,S
878,what is the the basic thing that that you are um obligated to do um uh by the summer before uh we can move,D
882,so what happened is,D
952,yeah.,S
971,does i mean they sort of,D
975,like let's just look at the case when um this is actually the the final action right?,S
981,yeah.,S
1073,so i gave uh bhaskara a copy of this uh sort of ninety two paper.,S
1133,is,D
1149,uh basically whatever it's probabilistically whatever it would be.,S
1187,well my point was more that we just uh,D
1200,but anyway,F
1201,so,F
1202,and i i think that's the standard way people get around the uh,D
1206,the,D
1210,still sort of leaves one question.,S
1221,it'll be students,D
1229,and we'll write it down in a flat file.,S
1231,so,D
1267,yeah.,S
1282,uh,F
1283,but it's uh well it strikes me as a what,D
1296,yeah.,B
1300,what i don't think is ever going to be in the ontology is sort of you know the likelihood of uh people entering town halls and looking at town halls and approaching town halls.,S
1327,okay.,S
1370,we could just steal the classes in javabayes and then interface to them with our own code.,S
1380,you know.,S
1420,but he did do it.,S
1448,don't know.,S
1455,okay.,S
1458,okay.,B
2,so we are recording.,S
17,huh.,B
53,and so then you also have a digits form which needs to be filled out every time the speaker form only once the digit form every time.,S
81,um with andreas' help um andreas put together a sort of no frills recognizer.,S
100,i,D
126,i'm not,D
133,oh.,D
137,yeah.,S
139,so that's what we have.,S
182,but,F
183,um but that shouldn't affect anything.,S
193,no,F
194,oh and,D
249,well that would really be a problem.,S
251,so anyway these are just the ones that are the prebug for one meeting.,S
264,these are sort of funny ones.,S
271,um it's pretty good.,S
278,yeah.,S
316,and we were all getting like seventy percent error on switchboard.,S
321,huh.,B
327,oh it's the,D
332,so and what also this means is that,D
336,uh broadcast news.,S
359,so that's the that's the only acoustic training data that we have a lot of.,S
371,oh yeah.,S
376,yeah.,B
396,good point.,S
405,oh that's i'm glad.,S
414,and i i'm pretty sure from listening to eric that you know given the words he was saying and given his pronunciation that the reason that he's so much worse is the lapel.,S
418,so it's nice now if we can just sort of eliminate the lapel one when when we get new microphones.,S
422,i i i would bet on that too.,S
425,because he certainly in that when as a as a burp user he was he was a pretty uh strong one.,S
428,he he he sounded to me just from he sounded like a,D
451,yeah so,F
452,not that much the vocabulary actually.,S
455,yeah.,B
461,yeah.,F
462,p z m.,S
480,so,B
493,or have someone look at the alignments.,S
526,but but there's other phenomena.,S
530,yeah certainly i'd like to see as soon as we could.,S
543,i mean this way we least have a baseline.,S
554,sorry can't remember.,S
566,we we talked about setting up the s r i recognizer here.,S
570,certainly doable.,S
572,yeah and,F
573,well certainly if the recognition as opposed to training.,S
582,the uh the data that you take into s r i first first question.,S
586,from the outside world or,D
593,well okay.,F
594,we have no names.,S
643,so we wouldn't have to have it uh you know do it uh explicitly beforehand.,S
676,sure.,F
677,we can try it.,S
681,yeah.,B
684,uhhuh.,B
690,well i mean that was if it's the same then we can down sample here.,S
695,yeah.,S
697,no.,F
698,i mean it's not it wouldn't be a problem if you're interested in it.,S
716,and so you're just wondering whether the filter is,D
729,i mean so one is a half a percent better than the other.,S
736,mel cepstrum.,S
753,well we can try it if you generate like the same set of files just up to that point where we stopped anyway.,S
797,huh.,B
813,telephone.,S
819,so it's it's it's just that they were operating from switchboard which was a completely telephone data base.,S
822,okay.,S
845,yeah.,B
849,there was just one more thing i wanted to say which is totally unrelated to the recognition except that,D
851,well well it's sort of related.,S
853,good news also.,S
917,i mean one thing is it the whole thing as i said is is all structured in terms of forty eight kilohertz sampling.,S
922,i mean then we'd also have to get another a d d and another mixer and all that sort of stuff.,S
932,we can fit we have room for one more wireless.,S
968,they'd,D
970,no they'll just charge us more.,S
1007,uh right.,S
1019,that's a good idea.,S
1039,that's a very,D
1052,well or also for you know if people are not,D
1077,so i wonder if they have one that will hook up.,S
1092,yeah just these ones that they pass around with no you know wireless.,S
1103,right.,B
1105,so this is a good point.,S
1119,yeah because there's only i mean as andreas pointed out actually i think in the large the larger the group the less interaction the less people are talking um over each other.,S
1124,right.,B
1128,okay.,F
1129,so i guess people who have to leave can leave.,S
1172,oh.,S
1216,number two would be sort of a the the transcription process.,S
1227,yeah.,F
1228,see what they're doing and also present what what we've chosen as ours and and discuss that kind of thing.,S
1233,and everybody who wants to attend is welcome.,S
1235,yeah.,B
1268,well have a time mark.,S
1273,and just clip it to your collar.,S
1316,cool.,B
25,me too.,S
134,huh i remember that now.,S
153,okay it's just i'm just thinking that if,D
188,the s.m. ten a.'s.,S
194,but they were they seemed pretty good.,S
203,so we should buzz that out if we send the data to sony.,S
210,huh.,B
212,also we're i want to double check with morgan.,S
225,and also i'm going to probably replace the andrea mike with a shure.,S
248,so i've never had to,D
257,file,D
283,uh file reorganization.,S
295,i know that the files that you've been cutting up for us for the recognition experiments,D
305,uh i guess.,S
308,so it's just a question of of what decompression is built into your tools.,S
313,i didn't know that.,S
319,well that's not a sound tool.,S
324,uhhuh.,B
357,uhhuh.,B
381,you know what would be a,D
398,but there's also some,D
418,yeah.,B
427,i mean the segmentation also saves you space in the sense that you cut out all the nonspeech regions.,S
436,huh,B
444,and,D
454,yeah so chuck helped me out in uh regenerating all the the different channel files for like a few meetings.,S
471,well what we what we found out was that um the disk that crashed was it with a with a meta disk allocation you had both transcripts and the shortened files and the expanded files were all on x e were on the same,D
527,maybe next week if we could.,S
539,just the backed up space.,S
544,various paths,D
555,i didn't really get any responses from the naming conventions that i sent out.,S
564,i will by next week though.,S
570,i wouldn't just want to change them you know without some advance notice.,S
579,well,D
582,you're talking about different files.,S
585,yep.,D
602,yeah it's not going to,D
607,i actually i was going to do a global search replace on all entries at at icsi.,S
632,doesn't need to reflect everything.,S
637,thilo you had you wanted to talk about the,D
667,and this is not just the transcriber.,S
694,oh well yeah i i i actually wasn't sure whether this is the right meeting for it.,S
699,and and you know this is the joint work with chuck.,S
701,so first uh you know we had we figured out sometime last week how to um,D
714,also for debugging purposes and for the heck of it i trained um trained uh on the same training set uh a standard system with the s r i front end from scratch.,S
726,i do not know what,D
733,but the results are such that,D
759,for the c zero.,S
769,so there's a two,D
772,so without and with adaptation.,S
791,so without adaptation,D
808,at the utterance level right.,S
825,we could also do the vocal tract length normalization with the icsi features.,S
838,they won't,D
846,yeah and and then there's all these,D
848,you know the number of um,D
858,uh that hurt us.,S
861,huh!,S
864,but the good news is that even with this with the icsi system being that much worse you still get a win out of combining the two.,S
867,unfortunately however this seems to be reduced with adaptation.,S
869,also interestingly the um the difference actually widens.,S
873,you know if you if you have some some difference in the front end processing that uh is suboptimal but can be possibly remedied by you know moving the um moving the models around,D
877,um anyway so right now what i'm doing is um,D
895,for for whatever that's worth.,S
919,right.,S
923,yeah and then we could start experimenting a little bit to try to get the icsi front end to perform better.,S
935,i was thinking about tandem system.,S
954,but it might be important for um,D
959,and this must become a problem especially with non speech meetings.,S
982,well if an unblacked out channel is zero is actually spitting out zeros you can be pretty sure it's off.,S
999,um.,F
1000,so maybe it's just to admonish people to actually look at the screen at the beginning of the meeting to make sure they get a signal.,S
1021,yeah.,S
13,and you wanted i know you wanted the far field data.,S
28,yeah.,S
30,that's about right.,S
35,that's true.,S
54,so the question is what,D
61,i mean it's the non overlap only.,S
63,it has to be enough to be sort of comparable to what you folks were seeing and what you reported already.,S
70,right.,S
72,we have a whole parallel set of things over here which are all with digits.,S
78,we already have these results that you,D
85,uh if we could on top of that,D
94,dave,D
97,well how many hours of training,D
129,yeah i would say we you do only males.,S
132,yeah so that's certainly part of the issue is that right now he's he hasn't written his stuff for efficiency.,S
142,but if we were dealing with two hundred hours or something i think it'd be prohibitive.,S
157,it you know appears to be you know debugged.,S
166,we have to cut the uh,D
171,and there's a bit of a question whether you want to use um what segmentations you want to use.,S
174,uh david just,D
179,it would be nice,D
190,so because i don't think the new data will be ready uh for a couple days probably.,S
193,the training.,S
201,yeah,D
216,and we were going to use one of the p z m's.,S
233,bet they'll have fun with that one.,S
235,uh,F
236,okay so uh i just want to make sure i understand what we need to run.,S
238,let's see.,S
255,if you were going to cut down on the test set i would suggest that.,S
261,the um,D
283,uh i i,F
284,i don't have i don't have a good,D
292,um,F
293,it's probably more than a day.,S
300,so you were doing like,D
304,uhhuh.,B
373,uh chuck had been asking about that earlier as kind of a control to know um,D
382,i'm i'm kind of questioning that.,S
385,well on a more basic level also it means that that third experiment there are actually two differences between the other experiments.,S
414,okay well i'll i can get started on the,D
446,i think for the purposes of just determining whether a far field microphone uh what the effect of the far field microphone is we should do the same to both.,S
469,but um,F
470,it's just easier to do.,S
510,it's not just speaker adaptation.,S
516,you know the most important of course is the cepstral mean subtraction.,S
534,and by the way,F
535,what,D
553,i also think that again once we got into it that um using some kind of clustering would probably work reasonably well there too.,S
557,we ought to be able to at least tell that it appears that things are coming from a particular direction.,S
567,uhhuh.,B
577,what we were hoping was that over the weekend we could do uh the um calculation on the training set.,S
580,uh maybe you know we could by the end of the weekend we could have the top one.,S
594,the other thing is um,D
599,segmentation.,S
603,so um,F
604,i don't want you to have to be burdened with doing a lot of stuff.,S
610,i mean i can certainly help with uh re training the short male models.,S
616,you you can i mean you could you could you could run the,D
618,you basically once the um the top the top one's done you could easily re run the whole set of experiments.,S
626,yeah the the bottom one would just be a matter of pointing it at a new set of files and kicking it off.,S
669,that will just be a copy of the one above it except for different models from training.,S
730,i'll check with david about that.,S
738,so so andreas um,D
759,but that's not necessarily any less data than the s r i hub five,D
763,no it is.,S
778,so do you have that processed there then.,S
797,oh okay.,S
806,from that you need the from the segmentations you'll have the list of wavefiles that the short uh set is trained on.,S
843,it doesn't make i don't think it makes that much of a difference.,S
849,let's see um,D
857,say this again.,S
886,when you use when you go to the large training set then leaving out macrophone actually sometimes helps you.,S
914,he already has the you already have the information.,S
941,no he's just gone to a smartkom workshop.,S
956,uhhuh.,B
43,besides with this big a group.,S
98,well one thing that came up in the morning in the morning was the um,D
126,pretty easily.,S
132,if that you know if if we just keep it simple then maybe it's still useful.,S
144,uh yeah i'm morgan.,S
176,you so we won't have to go through that.,S
195,well that was just one of the reasons.,S
206,uh,D
226,and,D
361,right.,B
369,because you know what what what james is going to be doing is looking at the user interface.,S
398,i guess if you had a meeting participant they could use the summary to refresh themselves about the meeting and then make up queries.,S
501,i'm not against the idea of a summary.,S
509,what i i think you know in most meetings.,S
543,you know it it's it's relative to what you're focus was on that meeting.,S
557,never i've never seen it at icsi.,S
563,i've when we when we have other meetings.,S
656,and here's sort of what they started talking about.,S
658,and just,D
664,liz you,D
691,the key thing there is that this is a description of database collection effort that they're talking about doing.,S
697,but that it's going to be a lot of effort on our part to create it and store it.,S
722,right.,S
725,well once the room is a little more fixed that's a little easier.,S
732,also c.m.u. has been doing this.,S
749,and not look at each other.,S
790,or,D
796,uhhuh.,B
819,i i i'm not worried about the cost of setting it up.,S
830,and know the position of the people.,S
864,i agree.,D
868,so,F
869,so i mean departing for the moment from the data collection question but actually talking about you know this group and what we actually want to do.,S
874,um,F
875,that's great.,S
968,picking out basically to let you pick out keywords.,S
990,and see score them.,S
1015,huh.,B
1071,if can we turn that just that that let,D
1094,i thought it was the projector for a moment.,S
1108,hello.,S
1142,so up to you.,S
1160,yet it's separate.,S
1173,yeah.,S
1192,maybe.,S
1253,well maybe one thing we could do is for the meetings we've already done,D
1278,well,D
1351,well and and one thing we we're saying important and we're saying interesting.,S
1373,uhhuh.,B
1389,yeah.,B
1405,getting electronic summary from a note-taking person if they happen to do it anyway.,S
1408,getting just uh digital pictures.,S
1452,well and again if we can figure out a way to jimmy a a a a very rough system say in a year then uh so that in the second and third years we we actually have something to.,S
1461,so yeah,F
1462,i think i just wanted to say one thing about queries.,S
1481,it but it may well,D
1500,well not maybe not true wizard of oz.,S
1502,oh yeah i i understand.,S
1510,yeah.,S
1540,so,F
1541,huh.,B
1558,or maybe we should wait until the summary of this until this meeting is transcribed.,S
1577,people are supposed to send me u.r.l.'s.,S
1592,right.,B
1604,um,F
1605,mostly together.,S
1611,my july is really very crowded.,S
1642,and then what they're going to do is take the c.d. rom and transfer it to analog tape.,S
1648,yeah foot foot pedals.,S
1664,i mean what we will give them all of it right?,S
1679,it's also won't be adding much to the data to give them the mixed.,S
1725,oh okay.,S
1737,okay.,S
1746,no i think that's fine.,S
1754,yeah.,S
1771,yeah.,S
1785,yeah.,B
1787,i think my father would last through the second prompt before he hang hung up.,S
1793,okay.,B
1808,huh.,B
1810,but we have it it's it's pretty,D
1830,we'll find out.,S
1832,um and i will email these notes.,S
1852,but it's it might be,D
1874,you know otherwise if you guys have any papers,D
1876,i could i could use uh i could use your web pages.,S
1916,c.m.u.,S
1928,okay.,S
1932,okay i think that's good that's that's pretty much all i can think of.,S
1937,um i i know that from with the near field mikes some of the problems that come with overlapping speech uh are lessened.,S
1947,uh so we're going to have you know non overlapping samples anyway.,S
1965,but mark and others have said that there's quite a lot of found data from the discourse community that has this characteristic.,S
1973,so it also depends on the style of the group of people.,S
2031,and then the c.m.u. folks and i were sort of on the other side in,D
2048,if people were interested they could talk to them.,S
2061,intelligent room sorts of things.,S
2084,uh,F
2085,hopefully everybody here is on that list.,S
2157,oh good man!,S
2161,i,D
2188,that's a good point.,S
2201,um,F
2202,so i'm going to pass for the moment.,S
67,maybe it was too fast plunging in there because we have two updates.,S
106,the yeah the computer system sits right in front of you.,S
141,around four-ish.,S
190,yeah so let's uh see i i think that from one point of view uh um all these places are the same.,S
200,uh yeah i usually visit zoos or i usually visit castles or i usually,D
218,so i don't exactly understand,D
238,okay.,S
244,yeah this was sort of these are all different sort of activities.,S
256,you know they should get the feeling that there are these six things they have to do.,S
259,yeah.,F
260,well i think,D
266,uhhuh.,B
324,it in fact um i am just you know today next couple days going to start really diving into this data.,S
418,yeah.,S
438,you know any of that stuff.,S
504,the function stuff is definitely different and the getting information or stuff yeah.,S
554,okay.,F
555,so so this tour is sort of just like the idea of current round of of touristness or whatever.,S
558,okay.,S
568,okay.,S
624,yeah i mean like for example my my father is about to travel to prague.,S
741,and you know if we feel that they want to do nothing but that thing then you know we should point out that to the planner that they probably want to use all the time they have.,S
750,the user can always say it but it's just sort of we we hand over these parameters if we make if we have a feeling that they are important.,S
756,and yeah and part of the system design is that if it looks to be important and you can't figure it out then you ask.,S
795,so i think there are a variety of things in which um,D
930,you know whatever form they use is fine.,S
1042,now it we talked about this before.,S
1079,for the first cut that should be fine yeah.,S
1097,that's about six times in this little one here so uh yeah.,S
1131,i'll be gone.,S
2,so the only agenda items were jane was jane wanted to talk about some of the i b m transcription process.,S
9,right.,S
15,but,F
16,well yeah you sent it in late.,S
19,and then,D
23,oops.,S
33,but,F
34,uh dave gelbart sent me email i think he sent it to you too that um there's a special topic section in in eurospeech on new corpora.,S
46,oh!,S
50,so i thought it was highly relevant.,S
64,i'll help.,S
67,i think several people sent this.,S
71,yeah.,S
75,yeah.,B
78,there there were some interesting results in this paper though.,S
112,yeah.,B
118,huh.,B
122,well it was about it had three sections.,S
126,three kinds of uh results if you will.,S
130,in terms of in terms of number of words.,S
140,and found that the,D
142,you know as you might expect the meeting recorder meetings had the most overlap.,S
148,one sort of unexpected result there is that uh two party telephone conversations have about the same amount of overlap.,S
161,yeah.,B
178,well,F
179,yeah we we have pretty limited sample here.,S
181,but,F
192,it just says that it's a bell curve and that you have something that has a nice range in your sampling.,S
238,it's an interesting result regardless.,S
249,so basically you treat backchannels as nonspeech as pauses.,S
258,so it's uh,D
282,so so if you have the foreground speaker speaking here and then there's some background speech may be overlapping it somehow.,S
292,that's somewhat that's somewhat subject to error.,S
308,so,D
322,huh.,B
344,i mean you still,D
352,yeah.,S
361,so that was number that was the second set of uh the second section.,S
368,you know,F
390,so we only looked at cases where there was a foreground speaker.,S
406,on t closures only.,S
409,to for for the purposes of this analysis we tagged the word sequences and and we time aligned them.,S
411,and we considered it interrupt if it occurred in the middle of a word.,S
429,uh filled pauses.,S
445,and then we looked at the,D
450,that for instance after,D
453,and also of course after spurt ends.,S
458,i wonder,D
467,right.,S
476,yeah.,B
488,or more.,S
498,and until it,D
518,and that they tend to happen when uh the pitch drops.,S
523,do you,D
531,this is purely based on you know the words.,S
540,about,D
551,to handle those people that call you on the phone and just like to talk and talk and talk.,S
559,while that thing keeps them busy.,S
579,huh.,B
585,that's that's what i do.,S
592,so the paper's online.,S
604,but i haven't sent it out yet.,S
608,so if there's any suggestions you have for that i was just going to send him the,D
613,he still has his unix account here you know.,S
645,the no vowels.,S
647,and then under there,D
656,uh and the directory for this i call it a s r zero point one.,S
668,so all i all i was going to do there was stick the the transcripts after we the way that we munged them for scoring.,S
671,um,F
672,and also and then the the waveforms that don segmented.,S
676,but i'll probably move them there as well.,S
695,but yeah.,F
696,we can send i can c c mari on this so that she knows,D
722,okay because in one directory there's two versions.,S
736,we should probably uh give them the non downsampled versions.,S
739,okay.,F
740,all right then i'll hold off on that and i'll wait for you to,D
742,probably by tomorrow.,S
761,but um they probably want the originals.,S
765,good.,S
774,that's why it was good to have andreas say these things.,S
782,you you should probably talk about that.,S
787,my understanding was that,D
789,i haven't i haven't listened to it yet.,S
852,like when we went to,D
854,when i was listening to the original file that adam had it's like you you hear a word then you hear a beep and then you hear the continuation of what is the same sentence.,S
858,and and so the,D
879,yeah.,S
885,oh.,S
898,uh,F
899,it i don't care that you know there's actually abutting segments that we have to join together.,S
905,i think jane tightened these up by hand.,S
918,i,D
929,but just just you know get an i just wanted to have an idea of the of how much extra you allowed.,S
931,so that i can interpret the numbers if i compared that with a forced alignment segmentation.,S
933,i can't answer that.,S
961,without really stopping.,S
996,so,F
997,it's sort of a compromise.,S
1002,so,F
1003,yeah i also used i think something around zero point five seconds for the speech nonspeech detector.,S
1008,yeah.,B
1019,and i sent the path.,S
1026,yeah and hopefully the new meetings which will start from the channelized version will will have better time boundaries and alignments.,S
1032,yeah.,B
1048,yeah.,F
1049,that would be more natural.,S
1051,but,D
1061,so i've assigned i've i've assigned them to our transcribers.,S
1063,so far i've discussed it with one.,S
1073,the the the maximal gain it's from the i b m people may be in long stretches of connected speech.,S
1081,so um,F
1082,and certainly things that are intrusions of multiple words taken out of context and displaced in time from where they occurred that would be hard.,S
1088,well it,D
1097,oh also at the same time she when she goes through this she'll be uh if there's anything that was encoded as a pause but really has something transcribable in it then she's going to uh make a mark.,S
1099,uh so you know that that bin would be marked as it as double dots.,S
1133,i'm now i'm confused.,S
1139,okay leave the mikes on.,S
1198,she it's a question of how much time we want our transcriber to invest here when she's going to have to invest that when it comes back from i b m anyway.,S
1220,okay good.,S
1246,yeah.,B
1343,so we just run that one,D
1352,yep.,S
1445,so,F
1446,or maybe percentage isn't the right word.,S
1451,you know.,F
1452,yeah.,F
1453,the the problem is that nnn the numbers ian gave in the paper is just uh some frame error rate.,S
1459,huh.,B
1486,yeah it's perhaps then it's perhaps five percent of something.,S
1497,so,F
1498,and i guess we could just indicate to the transcribers not to encode that if they,D
1507,yeah.,B
1523,you know if they they hear you know a dog bark and they say what was the word.,S
1550,yeah because the other thing that was concerning me about it was that it seemed kind of specialized to the e d u meeting.,S
1567,well good.,S
1569,that that really simplifies thing then.,S
1614,i i didn't think of of of this before.,S
1621,sometimes the the the laptop is in the background.,S
1648,so,F
1649,i mean,F
1650,so my standard approach has been if it's not someone close miked then they don't end up on one of the close miked channels.,S
1658,when when this is sent to to the i m uh i b m transcribers i don't know if if they can tell that's really,D
1666,right but uh in general i don't think we want them transcribing the background.,S
1736,i it doesn't,D
1765,good.,S
1805,all right.,F
1806,okay.,B
4,eva bhaskara and i did.,S
14,ha!,S
81,all the possible outputs too.,S
113,well well it's an x m l structure that's being returned.,S
124,and um,F
125,the reason is why i think it's a little bit more complex or why why we can even think about it as an interesting problem in and of itself is,D
127,so the uh,D
139,we want to know um is does he want info.,S
147,um,F
148,do this in perl.,S
153,we should be able to conclude from that that,D
179,i don't know whether i understand what you mean.,S
227,okay.,B
229,let's not forget we're going to get some very strong input from these from these discourse things.,S
232,tell me the location of x.,S
286,assume we have something coming in.,S
293,i'm not drinking tea.,S
312,okay and,F
313,go there has two values.,S
324,oh i see why we can't do that.,S
333,this like that ..,S
384,so but but if we have a finite,D
418,i don't not necessarily i would think.,S
422,so someone asked a question.,S
455,go there is no.,S
470,uh,F
521,there was a confusion there.,S
534,you may not even bother to compute things you don't need.,S
568,well in the case of go there it would be.,S
595,i guess jerry needs to enter marks.,S
605,assuming she's coming to this meeting.,S
613,because,D
660,and then it's just uh edges.,S
699,oh i think we should disappoint him.,S
703,that wouldn't be disappointing.,S
732,the whole group.,S
750,yeah.,F
751,because you know,D
762,that you will have in about nine months or so.,S
766,the first bad version will be done in nine months.,S
780,like the go there depends on all those four things.,S
859,i mean i might slip out and say it accidentally.,S
869,and um,F
870,then,D
898,well,F
914,and form starts at the level of noun or actually maybe even sounds.,S
930,it's yeah i would definitely say it's finite.,S
18,i don't know how much of a chance you had to actually read it.,S
27,it basically says well this is construal.,S
50,yeah no i i i see this has got the castle in it and stuff like that.,S
76,we can talk about it later.,S
79,okay go on to uh whatever.,S
81,i'm making changes.,S
94,and uh email any time.,S
113,then i'm also going to present a little talk at e m l about what we have done here.,S
115,of course i'm i'm going to start out with this slide.,S
118,then i'm asking them to imagine that they're standing somewhere in heidelberg.,S
123,they're supposed to imagine that you know do they think the person wants to go there or just know where it is.,S
125,which is probably not uh the case in that discotheque example.,S
136,oh you've got the parser done.,S
144,the generation outputter.,S
194,i'm not going to put in the figures from liz.,S
198,sort of feed you back to our original problem.,S
251,which we are.,S
254,depends i mean there is a um whole language learning story.,S
264,and of course you know the the big picture is this bit.,S
277,and may not.,S
281,um how the construction and simulation,D
303,well i i don't feel bad about it at all.,S
318,it's it's certainly related.,S
320,because um e m l is building up a huge thing in leipzig.,S
379,the,F
380,the the combination of the biology and the leipzig connection might be interesting to these guys.,S
392,uh unless there's a person called jackendorf.,S
402,oh in the presentation here.,S
420,oh yeah okay.,S
431,uh okay so where where is it?,S
435,um it's just underneath uh um that reference to metaphor.,S
472,the trick is that the,D
518,right.,S
529,cars run into telephone poles all the time.,S
537,yeah run into might even be more impact sense than you know container sense.,S
545,there are idioms.,S
553,sudden surprising contact.,S
569,too bad.,S
574,this has gotten,D
582,in other news.,F
583,okay so um,F
597,well we have for example a canonical use of something.,S
613,join the club.,S
628,he's,D
635,and you can be you know on the wagon.,S
643,well unless he was repairing it or something.,S
647,uh but okay.,F
648,so in terms of the this,D
654,right.,B
683,i never really knew what was going on.,S
688,uh.,B
701,that's okay.,S
715,huh!,S
718,professional linguists.,S
721,there was this whole thesis on out of.,S
745,yeah.,S
749,it's not one of the it's more straightforward ones forward ones to defend.,S
805,uhhuh.,B
813,those are interesting examples.,S
820,might be beyond what you want to do.,S
834,no.,S
852,yeah i think that's a good example actually.,S
862,yeah.,S
877,how far is it from here.,S
880,you're also not referring to the width of the object or so.,S
887,huh.,B
892,where where where was um,D
906,but anyway so there are there are cases like that.,S
908,uh.,B
913,um.,F
914,i mean there's also things like i mean,D
916,i guess i could ask something like where can i find out about blah blah blah.,S
931,well i i i,D
942,yeah yeah right.,S
983,yeah.,B
1004,right.,S
1016,right.,S
1057,we we can show people pictures of objects.,S
19,yeah.,B
28,actually i may not be here either.,S
30,i got to double check the dates.,S
39,and that works fine.,S
70,so what i did is i just took the file with those in it converted it so that it looks like an audio file.,S
89,and the only problem with that is that there's a bug in transcriber.,S
94,but the solution to that is just set the option so it doesn't compute the shape file and it will work.,S
115,and that's all right.,S
265,yeah so it's coming along.,S
268,just hacking dan's code and stepping through it.,S
277,okay well i'm going to start working on this the week after next.,S
285,okay.,S
314,it's always exciting to hear that java's faster than something.,S
322,well it is wonderful.,S
339,okay.,S
342,huh.,B
374,and i didn't hear back.,S
387,and it's it's case insensitive.,S
394,i just approved all mine.,S
403,it's hard to find.,S
428,yeah.,S
438,yep.,S
447,stalk them at their,D
466,because i bet she has this information.,S
524,i haven't done a,D
556,yeah but we can be sure that as or we can be not not totally sure.,S
563,so it it,D
575,that's pretty good i think.,S
641,but,D
658,no.,S
677,yeah he,D
686,is is,D
692,i might not work.,S
728,they're stored on popcorn.,S
765,that's what i'm doing now.,S
790,great.,S
798,uhhuh.,B
815,some,D
819,yeah.,B
832,well it's an interesting question because i was thinking well you can force align the transcriber transcripts and then of course you try to merge them in time.,S
844,so maybe then that wouldn't be so bad.,S
855,right right.,B
867,yeah we we should try,D
902,but you're saying for this for the adaptation you mean.,S
913,huh.,B
954,you can use a speaker uh,D
978,yeah so you can,D
1020,but say if if you had a a cardioid mike or something sitting someplace then sitting there then it would its its response to him would be about the same as the response to him and so on.,S
1051,it's just going to pick up whatever energy difference or whatever is.,S
1059,huh.,B
1085,actually we're experimenting with phase stuff now.,S
1151,a oh it's a sort of feature normalization.,S
1293,that sounds great.,S
1296,yeah i mean i was thinking the other day that this is not just conversational speech.,S
1305,yeah.,S
1363,you know so she certainly can define it.,S
1383,it's saying so it's all above the table.,S
1403,does seem to me that it that it carries over some baggage with it that uh that,D
1481,but you know i i should also say that there's a lot of it's not just the word cheating but there's lots of other things that we talk about which as soon as you go outside of your narrow little group it gets very very confusing to people.,S
1544,i guess if i don't ever think of it as negative more like it's something we're not building.,S
1558,yeah.,F
1559,but,D
1571,uhhuh.,B
1579,huh.,B
1608,because although i think that the data are still useful in terms of providing content.,S
1617,if there's a way to check the signal quality before transcribing it and you find any problem at all it'd be much better to go to another meeting i think.,S
1624,it's just hard to tell between that and just someone not talking.,S
1629,well the and the other aspect of it is um that when the microphone is not well adjusted then even if it's not a lapel mike you can get lapel mike type behavior.,S
1689,yeah sometimes you you capture that when you mix it together.,S
1710,because of the you know the batteries flaked.,S
1718,and we have so many.,S
1728,yep.,B
1730,right there but there's a shortage of transcription power.,S
1740,oh good question.,S
3,yeah and i'm just,D
76,he's i i'm sorry i should have forwarded that along.,S
85,i i have the program to insert the beeps.,D
105,i i don't think it,D
128,i don't know.,S
136,yeah.,S
149,i'm just thinking that from a data keeping track of the data point of view it may be best to send them whole meetings at a time and not try to send them bits and pieces.,S
151,oh that's right.,S
197,i guess there is this issue of you know if if the segmenter thought there was no speech on on a particular stretch on a particular channel.,S
199,and there really was then if it didn't show up in a mixed signal to verify then it might be overlooked.,S
203,that's what it seems to me too in that if they need to just like in the other cases they can listen to the individual if they need to.,S
209,i don't see how that will work though.,S
284,i'm i'm now entirely confused about what they do.,S
355,huh!,B
382,huh.,B
387,isn't that,D
420,but right now to do this limitation the switching is going to be switching of the audio is what she's saying.,S
424,right.,S
433,i had suggested it before.,S
479,we'll just have to see.,S
492,unless our,D
522,there's zero a little bit and a lot.,S
555,or uh i extracted it incorrectly.,S
557,it was labeled.,S
586,yeah so i was curious about that.,S
602,i see.,S
605,yeah.,B
635,so we you know we had spent a lot of time um writing up the h l t paper.,S
646,so it's sort of good to hear that it was not straight forward thinking if we can get decent forced alignments then at least we can do sort of a overall report of what happens with actual overlap in time.,S
648,i didn't think that his message said it wasn't straight forward.,S
651,uhhuh.,B
656,right.,F
657,so you just have to look over longer time when you're trying to align the things.,S
665,yeah that was sort of a side issue.,S
676,yeah.,B
680,well less than a week.,S
696,i mean i don't care that the individual words are aligned correctly.,S
708,so i would need a i would need a channel that has a speaker whose who has a lot of overlap but you know is a non lapel mike.,S
751,every meeting.,S
769,if you had a if you had a if you had a script which would,D
779,i mean that that would be really helpful.,S
837,if you can feel confident that what the yeah that there's actually something,D
895,uh you know on the same channel the same speaker.,S
950,i mean we might be able at the very worst we can get transcribers to correct the cases where,D
976,i don't think so.,S
1002,well i know what we're not turning in to eurospeech.,S
1008,yeah.,B
1026,you said speaking about energy or something.,S
1045,the h l t paper is really more of a introduction to the project paper and um,D
1052,i mean i would see eurospeech if we have some eurospeech papers these will be paper uh submissions.,S
1092,yeah.,B
1095,i corrected it for a number of the words.,S
1097,i'm sure that um they're they're accurate now.,S
1154,then it then it falls back this way so it's,D
1191,hang a five pound weight off the back.,S
1201,um,F
1202,anyway.,F
1239,uhhuh.,B
1243,yeah i'm not too worried about that.,S
1260,no.,S
1272,but um basically it was about um uh going to a new task where you have insufficient data and using using data from something else and adapting and how well that works.,S
1296,you know the broadcast news nets were not nets.,S
1322,you mean they have some.,S
1340,well there're,D
1371,yeah.,B
1377,it has to be though someone from this group because of the technical nature of the thing.,S
1386,yep.,B
1401,well i didn't have as much disagreement as i would have liked.,S
1406,i mean the missing,D
1418,okay.,F
1419,and that you could do better with more data i mean that's clearly statistically,D
1421,yeah.,B
1447,this was my concern about the recognizer in aurora.,S
1449,that,D
1462,could well be.,S
1502,well that's getting,D
1504,yeah the spread was still pretty wide that's that's true.,S
1521,right.,B
1536,yeah.,S
1567,and there's cost.,S
1600,you know there's arguments on both sides.,S
1604,that was a very offending.,S
1613,i mean so,F
1614,and i'm saying the same thing happened with speech recognition.,S
1624,anyway.,F
4,for whatever that's,D
7,yeah they're they're having birthday cake and such.,S
10,and so i can't miss that.,S
20,only a couple of agenda items since no one sent me email for agenda items.,S
78,huh.,B
89,can i i i just,D
126,yeah just say okay is ten minutes is,D
132,well the only other issue is we'd have to worry about reassembling them in the proper order.,S
134,yeah.,B
168,yes it would be because it's very very regular.,S
189,so is this a,D
236,so just truly chromatically up all the way through the entire meeting.,S
286,you'd have to they'd have to have the acoustics of dogs hear into the high high ranges.,S
322,they've got headphones.,S
333,it's a shame we can't really give a number.,S
405,yeah.,S
470,oh of a of a segment that they're hearing?,S
477,i don't know.,S
505,right.,B
515,well and the other thing is maybe the numbers would help them keep their place in the transcript and speed the process,D
523,okay.,S
540,you know actually what all that we would,D
556,right.,B
568,and then you have a beep model.,S
576,well but all we'll get,D
581,so it's so it's really just doing yeah a keyword like a spotting for beep with,D
593,no i'm not i'm not suggesting that we don't have anything between the beeps.,S
650,it's just an idea if if it turns out that,D
676,so just,D
699,yeah it's there.,S
703,because i was gone last week.,S
722,we still haven't really sat down and talked about file reorganization.,S
730,so let's let's try to do that sometime.,S
736,we also still have to make a decision about mike issues.,S
762,it it moves us away from this uniform all the mikes are the same.,S
765,the other thing too is you said that the acoustic quality of the one that you're wearing the fancy one is actually somewhat better than,D
775,for instance just the fact that people sit in different positions different times.,S
779,i i just don't,D
784,the other stuff is just going to some variability we're going to have to accept.,S
795,okay.,S
800,or even if we could attach two headband,D
879,i got this crazy idea that um in the future people will just walk around with the microphones that they use for their cell phones.,S
962,if we have a i've always wondered how well they would work.,S
976,an adaptor might be a better idea than redoing the wiring all the time.,S
985,so we have you know some kind of little something.,S
991,yep.,B
1008,do we have one of these,D
1017,uh bluetooth is shorter range.,S
1042,who well we're talking about a fairly limited group.,S
1058,i mean there are lots of ways of doing it.,S
1074,i think what we have now,D
1095,yeah that's true.,S
1113,yeah.,B
1232,and if they have accounts here and they're modifying it,D
1248,yeah.,S
1361,good point.,S
1370,uhhuh.,B
1374,yeah.,B
1387,yeah thank you.,S
10,yeah that would be,D
30,we talk about the the results of,D
51,which is,D
58,yeah.,B
73,as a simplification he originally did this only using silence as uh a putative uh speaker change point.,S
98,so anyway i just reporting that.,S
100,okay.,S
160,yeah.,F
161,and so you change parameters.,S
165,you can specify the minimum length of speech or and silence portions which you want.,S
171,to have more or less uh silence portions inserted.,S
173,right so this would work well for uh pauses and utterance boundaries and things like that.,S
189,but it it saves so much time the the transcribers.,S
191,yep.,S
195,um just one quickly uh still on the features.,S
240,um i spoke i had a meeting with dave gelbart on on and he had uh excellent ideas on how the interface could be modified to to do this kind of representation.,S
252,susanne burger who is at c m u he who was formally at in munich and and is now at with c m u.,S
270,i also wanted to be sure,D
307,but you,D
341,i mean basically he's he's on it now.,S
382,and just keep those things separate.,S
394,the waveform you're looking at doesn't change.,S
426,oh we should definitely get with them then.,S
428,agree upon a format.,S
437,yeah i think that's right.,S
439,so yeah maybe i'll uh ping them a little bit about it to get that straight.,S
441,i'm keeping the conventions absolutely as simple as possible.,S
450,yeah.,B
452,there was also this uh email from dan regarding the speech non nonspeech segmentation thing.,S
458,uh we want to,D
460,and dan and dave gelbart is interested in pursuing the aspect of using amplitude as a a a as a basis for the separation.,S
470,okay.,B
475,and those those systems work very well by the way.,S
479,and uh those if,D
484,so,F
485,because there is one thing that we don't have right now and that is the automatic um channel identifier.,S
491,uhhuh.,B
510,but,F
511,uh you certainly want to use the close talking as a at least.,S
530,it the it's basically a two tiered structure where the first one is whether the person who's interrupted continues or not.,S
536,and i hope that if we do a forced alignment with the close talking mike that will be enough to recover at least some of the time the time information of when the overlap occurred.,S
549,oh okay.,S
578,yeah.,B
585,um uh,F
612,so one thing is that i did look on sony's for a replacement for the mikes for the head head worn ones.,S
623,uhhuh.,B
632,uhhuh.,B
644,that'd be,D
651,just in terms of how you wear them,D
658,well i think that that's that's a good back off position.,S
683,i talked to some i b m guys uh last january i think i was there.,S
685,so people who were working on the on their viavoice dictation product.,S
699,everyone's adjusting their microphones of course.,S
710,they were they were perturbed with me.,S
715,yeah.,B
736,i mean i think,D
748,and then you know i think there's not much,D
788,it is useful to transcribe and then ultimately train models for things like breath.,S
792,if you can in your transcripts mark,D
794,mark them.,S
799,they're putting uh so in curly brackets they put inhale or breath.,S
836,huh.,B
847,yeah.,B
905,yeah.,B
912,it didn't work as well so.,S
935,one thing that that we're not doing of course is we're not claiming to uh get be getting a representation of mankind.,S
948,okay.,S
963,i trained them to uh on about a minute or two of the one that was already transcribed.,S
1023,i think they know that the data source is limited.,S
1028,oh that'd be so super.,S
1059,uhhuh.,D
1078,and then school will start in in the on the sixteenth.,S
1081,some of them will have to cut back their hours at that point.,S
1118,uhhuh.,B
1120,uhhuh.,B
1138,it could be that they will uh theirs will end up being a kind of first pass or something.,S
1174,you know they both help each other.,S
1178,excellent.,D
1188,i mean i i i did sort of a a rough pass on encoding like episode like level things on the uh transcribed meeting.,S
1204,yeah.,B
1207,i think it just whoever is interested can do that.,S
1219,uhhuh.,B
1222,we could skip the digits.,S
1225,i i i think it you know another another bunch of digits,D
1241,in the in the measurement uh the average uh dividing by the by the um variance.,S
1258,but the bottom line is it's still not uh separating out very well.,S
1278,it looks like,D
1290,but uh,F
1291,a completely different tack on it is the one that was suggested uh by your colleagues in spain.,S
1302,and uh try to try to determine you know when is when are you in an overlap when are you not in an overlap.,S
1313,its main limitation is that again it's only looking at silences which would,D
1319,uhhuh.,B
1338,no.,S
1358,it's only speech or it's it's it's nonspeech.,S
1364,it doesn't have the same uh h m m modeling.,S
1369,well it's sort of has a simple one.,S
1392,you mean uh uh javier program.,S
1394,uhhuh.,S
1403,this is the idea.,S
1423,it's a good method.,S
1429,yeah.,S
1431,the other thing one could do is couldn't,D
1443,i'm not sure.,S
1473,by your friends.,S
1476,anyway.,S
1478,yeah.,B
1481,um,F
1482,as with a lot of things it is not uh like this it's not as simple as it sounds.,S
1492,he's been playing around with a lot of these different things.,S
1497,i i still have a hunch that there's it's in there some place.,S
1549,the,D
1567,i i have as well.,S
1,let's see.,F
2,yeah barry's not here and dave's not here.,S
8,um,F
9,yeah it's it's interesting.,S
16,um,F
17,a fair amount of,D
23,and actually it brought up a question which may be relevant to the aurora stuff too.,S
26,but one of the differences that we found between the two systems that we were using the the aurora h.t.k. system baseline system and the system that we were the the uh other system we were using the uh the s.r.i. system was that the s.r.i. system had maybe a um hundred hertz high pass.,S
35,if you're using the baseline.,S
56,so anything less than sixty four is zero.,S
69,so it's it's a weight on the ball spectrum.,S
74,okay.,S
77,um,F
78,still it's possible that we're getting in some more noise.,S
84,yeah we we've tried including the full full bank.,S
102,um,F
103,so it was,D
121,uhhuh.,B
125,anyway that was just something we wondered about.,S
127,uh certainly a lot of the noise uh is uh below a hundred hertz.,S
131,but it's still pretty noisy.,S
137,i mean the main the the,D
146,and uh which we keep on during every every session we record.,S
158,so those are those are major components i think.,S
163,but um,F
164,it uh,D
168,so i think when when he gets done with his prelim study i think one of the next things we'd want to do is to take this uh uh noise uh processing stuff and and uh uh synthesize some speech from it.,S
176,so,F
177,uh it might even be sooner.,S
183,a week.,S
198,yep.,S
208,um it's kind of hard to take advantage of of of big chunks of data.,S
214,um,F
215,uh,F
216,that one really benefited from the larger set.,S
219,that uh that seemed to be,D
224,that's sort of what we found.,S
259,um but the software seemed to compile fine and everything.,S
261,and um,F
262,so,F
279,yeah.,S
290,okay.,S
301,uhhuh.,B
305,so they are actually trying to uh fix that those values using the clean uh training part of the wall street journal.,S
318,yeah.,B
320,but it's still worth i think just since you know just chatting with joe about the issue.,S
333,okay.,S
337,right.,B
339,but i mean i think it all should come up eventually.,S
357,susi or whatever it was.,S
362,okay.,S
370,that's good.,S
373,i noticed just glancing at the uh hopkins workshop uh web site that uh um one of the i don't know well we'll see how much they accomplish but one of the things that they were trying to do in the graphical models thing was to put together a a uh tool kit for doing uh um arbitrary graphical models for uh speech recognition.,S
378,oh uh do you know geoff zweig?,S
388,wow.,S
395,um,F
396,huh.,B
398,huh.,B
406,yeah it was actually,D
411,yeah.,S
415,this is what we get after this.,S
451,that's great.,S
457,the the latency of the v.a.d. is two hundred and twenty milliseconds.,S
472,so it's two twenty.,S
480,then there is um the neural network which use nine frames.,S
484,after that um you have the um filtering of the silence probabilities.,S
489,plus there is a delta at the input.,S
495,so it's,D
497,it's like forty plus forty plus,D
505,so it's two hundred actually.,S
512,if you are using,D
514,plus the frame.,S
521,okay.,S
526,forty cleaning.,S
572,no.,S
580,but well we could probably put the delta um before online normalization.,S
590,yeah.,S
594,uh then then it could go in parallel.,S
602,it should not make,D
607,uhhuh.,S
634,uh okay.,S
636,but still that's that's a pretty big uh win.,S
646,let's say ten milliseconds seconds for the l.d.a.,S
650,and then forty for the other.,S
667,on the in the,D
683,and you could experiment with cutting various pieces of these back a bit.,S
719,so it's,D
725,but,F
726,yeah.,B
728,uh,F
729,i mean the important thing is that we learn how to do this better.,S
731,so,F
732,um,F
733,yeah.,F
734,so our,D
736,yeah you can see the kind of kind of numbers that we're having say on speechdat-car.,S
748,yeah.,S
753,it's almost an average.,S
781,and sixty two with the the you know quote unquote cheating v.a.d.,S
795,i just did the configuration that's very similar to what we did for the february proposal.,S
797,um,F
798,so there is a a first feature stream that use uh straight m.f.c.c. features.,S
803,i don't have the,D
806,those two.,S
825,uh yeah.,F
826,right now it seems that i just tested on speechdat-car while the experiment are running on your on t.i. digits.,S
833,like on the well match and medium mismatch the gain is around five percent relative.,S
840,from the networks it's twenty eight.,S
856,oh.,S
862,yeah.,B
865,um,F
866,yeah.,B
876,yeah.,B
878,we have to find a way to decrease the number of features.,S
880,so it seems funny that i don't know maybe i don't quite understand everything but that adding features,D
892,or or suppose it wasn't completely terrible.,S
906,so highly mismatched condition means that in fact your training is a bad estimate of your test.,S
918,i don't know.,S
928,well we might uh we might have to experiment with uh better training sets.,S
935,um,F
936,uh,F
951,the reason i did it this ways is that in february it we we tested different things like that.,S
955,so you tried the global k.l.t. before.,S
957,yeah.,S
968,since things are things are different.,S
980,tandem features are used as they are.,S
983,yeah maybe we can add some context from these features also as dan did in in his last work.,S
988,uh now i lost track of what i was thinking.,S
990,what is the,D
1006,uh,F
1007,they felt they wanted to set a limit.,S
1012,uhhuh.,B
1022,they're being fed into these uh variants only gaussians and so forth.,S
1024,uhhuh.,B
1052,um,F
1053,um,F
1064,and again you did experiments back then where you made it bigger.,S
1075,it's all the noises are from the t.i. digits.,S
1080,well it's like the high mismatch of the speechdat-car.,S
1129,uhhuh.,B
1147,i mean this may be,D
1150,uh,F
1151,yeah uh,D
1153,so maybe it's treating some things differently.,S
1155,i i just that could be seen from the t.i. digits uh testing condition.,S
1160,so cleaning up the t.i. digits.,S
1167,then it's something to do.,S
1175,so there's lots of different kinds of acoustic conditions.,S
1181,i mean what we were,D
1195,yeah.,S
1205,uhhuh.,B
1219,the most noisy cases are the distant microphone for testing.,S
1222,well maybe the noise subtraction is subtracting off speech.,S
1226,yeah.,B
1233,well that that says that you know the um the models in in uh the recognizer are really paying attention to the neural net features.,S
1237,but yeah.,F
1238,actually the timit noises are sort of a range of noises.,S
1245,uh car i think.,S
1250,street or airport or something.,S
1267,it was a little bit worse.,S
1271,so,F
1272,until you put the second path in with the pure features the neural net wasn't helping at all.,S
1277,yeah.,B
1281,as soon as we added l.d.a. online normalization and all these things then,D
1290,but if on the other hand uh it's say somewhere in between what you're seeing now and and and uh what you'd have with just the pure features then maybe there is some problem of a of a uh combination of these things or correlation between them somehow.,S
1296,so what's the overall,D
1326,yeah it should be pretty close to cancelled out.,S
1347,so this is a two dimensional tile.,S
1361,what do we do with the a.n.n. is is something like that.,S
1378,uh,F
1379,but i mean but the other features that you have um the non tandem ones,D
1385,uhhuh.,S
1431,and in principle you would think that the neural net would do better at the discriminant part than l.d.a.,S
1436,yeah.,S
1449,i was just wondering,D
1460,yeah.,S
1479,so i think yeah it's definitely a good idea to try it.,S
1486,but but but uh,F
1487,yeah what i mean is it's it's like in the hub five evaluations you know.,S
1492,yeah.,B
1494,it's the transformation they're estimating on.,S
1507,i mean part of why,D
1522,i've been exploring a parallel v.a.d. without neural network.,S
1526,after the after the noise compensation i was trying to find a feature based on the ratio of the energies that is after clean and before clean.,S
1533,the advantage being like it doesn't have the latency of the neural net if it if it can.,S
1545,so um,F
1546,so,F
1547,but,F
1548,i'm sorry.,S
1559,uhhuh.,B
1570,so yeah.,F
1571,so the the the biggest,D
1579,um,F
1580,so there are there was like some problem in balancing the deletions and insertions when i try different thresholds.,S
1583,the,D
1603,yeah.,F
1604,yeah.,B
1606,but just,D
1614,but just like just to know that everything is fine.,S
1627,yeah.,F
1628,well what i think you know would be more what you'd want to do is is is uh put it into another neural net.,S
1634,yeah we're we're not quite there yet.,S
1644,instead of just having uh those cleaned up cepstrum should we feed some additional information like the the,D
1655,because most of it is,D
1663,the biggest classification would be the speech and silence.,S
1672,i see.,S
1697,yeah so,F
1698,maybe yeah when,D
1711,i mean,D
1717,right.,S
1720,that's what,D
1741,now the only thing that that bothers me about all this is that i i i the the fact,D
1748,is too high.,S
1755,it may not be it,D
1768,for the,D
1777,it it seems that the v.a.d. network doesn't well it doesn't drop uh too many frames.,S
1786,uhhuh.,B
1796,well we we don't have it actually.,S
1810,but it would be interesting to see if that was the problem anyway.,S
1816,but that's,D
1822,which is probably true.,S
1828,yeah.,B
1830,anyway.,F
1831,might be.,S
1847,it was giving slightly better results.,S
1852,uh,F
1853,huh.,F
1854,i think,D
1859,yeah.,F
1860,and then anyway we would have to reduce this with the k.l.t.,S
1863,but,F
1864,i don't know.,F
1865,yeah.,S
1878,around five percent better i guess.,S
1907,yeah.,B
1912,well.,D
1915,um,F
1916,so i won't be here for,D
1923,so i,D
1942,yeah.,S
1950,and,F
1961,but uh,F
1962,i guess just,D
1989,huh so it's just uh the next two where there will be there you know may as well be meetings.,S
1996,thirty first august.,S
1999,so,F
2000,cool.,S
2011,yeah.,B
2016,so the evaluation should be on a week before.,S
2020,but no this is good progress.,S
2022,uh,F
2023,okay.,S
1,some some introductions are in order.,S
5,getting ahead of myself.,S
7,um for those who don't know,D
32,i've got the headset on after all.,S
34,officially i guess he will be joining us in the summer.,S
76,it's very exciting.,S
82,not witch like.,S
93,didn't take a vote.,S
100,more than three of us.,S
124,so it was really carol snow who was confused not me and not jerry.,S
128,that's good.,S
150,than the,D
168,is it,D
175,do it.,S
182,as a matter of fact if you,D
204,yeah not only cogsci.,S
214,there the idea is now that next actually we we need to hire one more person to actually do that job.,S
222,visit,D
228,so out of these these high level categories the subject can pick a couple.,S
233,the person is able to take notes on a map that we will give him and the map will be a tourist's sort of schematic representation with with symbols for the objects.,S
240,and we're going to try out that.,S
249,right.,B
265,the map is more a means for them to have the buildings and their names.,S
319,okay.,S
333,the the goals that we've you guys have been talking about are this these you know identifying which of three modes um their question uh concerns.,S
371,well so the idea is to try to get the actual phrasing that they might use and try to interfere as little as possible with their choice of words.,S
376,which is never possible in a in a in a lab situation.,S
402,right.,B
481,i'll be here too actually.,S
490,just make a,D
512,i was like okay.,S
529,you can speak into it and ask for t v and movie information.,S
573,right.,S
575,but they're shown like on a screen.,S
591,and then you pick pick a movie and and and it shows you the times.,S
595,okay.,B
640,this is a,D
654,exactly.,S
661,even within the domain of entering in the light of a source path goal schema that we need to put in fill in additional structure up there.,S
665,it it is it was sort of a it gave us some headache.,S
713,here you have the action and the domain object.,S
752,because we've been arguing about it all week.,S
772,this is just uh x m l notational.,S
895,that's exactly what is necessary.,S
898,this referencing thing however is of temporary nature.,S
944,like forced motion and caused action and stuff.,S
998,would you say that the like,D
1008,um,F
1009,well for me it seems that uh,D
1031,so there's like levels of granularity.,S
1047,yeah.,B
1050,yeah i mean i i still am not entirely sure that i really fully grasp the syntax of this.,S
1128,every s p g every s p g action either is an enter or a view or an approach.,S
1138,it's it's it's flexible.,S
1140,well it sort of depends on on if you actually write down the the schema.,S
1146,maybe even not.,S
1152,but,D
1161,because you can either enter a building or view it or or approach it and touch it or something.,S
1170,so,D
1205,well every action has a set of related schemas.,S
1244,no.,S
1250,right.,B
1300,yeah that's all recorded.,S
1302,damn this project!,S
1308,i just don't see why you would,D
1347,because this is exactly the discussion we need need.,S
1353,you know don't worry.,S
1356,let's make a a a a sharper claim.,S
1393,this is this is a schema that defines x m l messages that are passed from one module to another.,S
1439,in principle what i i think that this approach does,D
1449,people reach their level of uh their level of at which they're incompetent or whatever.,S
1458,promote them.,S
1479,i'm i'm never happy when he uses the word roles.,S
1499,that's all i have for today.,S
1568,so already again this week.,S
1601,like have it we'll have it in writing.,S
1603,or better speech.,S
1605,this is it.,S
1607,the other good thing about it is jerry can be on here on friday.,S
1632,that's wonderful.,S
1638,okay.,B
1664,yeah and and there will be a a a relatively high level of redundancy.,S
1680,but we'll see that then and how how it sort of evolves.,S
1769,okay so friday.,S
2,somebody else should run this.,S
12,um,F
13,let's see maybe we should just get a list of items.,S
16,i guess there's the usual updates.,S
29,well the first thing maybe is that the eurospeech paper is uh accepted.,S
31,yeah.,F
39,so and the fff comments seems from the reviewer are good.,S
41,huh.,B
43,yeah.,F
49,september.,S
52,yeah.,F
53,then uh whhh,D
60,and so i have two recursions which are controlled by the um probability of the voice activity detector.,S
62,this actually don't doesn't seem to help.,S
65,but well both on line normalization approach seems equivalent.,S
78,well uh there is one thing that we can observe is that the mean are more different for for c zero and c one than for the other coefficients.,S
80,yeah.,F
81,and yeah it the c one is,D
85,so when you look at the trajectory of c one it's has a strange shape.,S
87,i was expecting the that these two mean helps.,S
96,huh but i still have to investigate further i think.,S
100,yeah.,S
107,uhhuh.,B
109,uh well this doesn't help neither.,S
112,it seems pretty,D
124,uhhuh.,B
126,i i thought morgan you brought it up a couple meetings ago.,S
136,uh well at least with the current on line normalization scheme.,S
138,we i think we kind of know that normalizing c one doesn't help with the current scheme.,S
140,and yeah.,F
141,in my idea i i was thinking that the the the reason is maybe because of these funny things that happen between speech and silence which have different means.,S
143,yeah.,S
146,i really would like to suggest looking um a little bit at the kinds of errors.,S
150,just seeing that each of these things didn't make things better may not be enough.,S
156,or um,F
157,um,F
158,you know helping with noisy case.,S
167,um,F
168,so that's it i think for the on line normalization.,S
170,yeah i've been playing a little bit with some kind of thresholding.,S
172,huh,F
173,as a first experiment i think,D
184,actually it was not a threshold.,S
190,yeah.,S
193,when we compare like a channel zero and channel one utterance,D
198,and yeah.,S
215,and the high energy portion of the speech don't get much affected anyway by the other noise.,S
221,so i mean again if you trained in one kind of noise and tested in the same kind of noise you'd you know given enough training data you don't do do badly.,S
226,so when you whiten it then it's like you the the only noise to to first order the only noise that you have is white noise.,S
247,uh,F
248,yeah but you're still getting more recognition errors.,S
254,yeah.,S
261,so but in this case i i really expect that maybe the the two these two stream of features they are very different.,S
265,uh i mean first place it's fifteen d b uh down across the utterance.,S
291,i see.,S
293,yeah.,B
295,which is not really noise actually.,S
300,i see.,S
309,yeah so,D
313,um,F
314,or or not constant but but uh varying over time in fact is another way to go.,S
318,yeah.,S
323,yeah it was it was uh the same system.,S
325,okay.,B
328,oh yeah.,F
329,a third thing is that um i play a little bit with the um finding what was different between um,D
333,he had the france telecom blind equalization in the system.,S
335,the number of m f c c that was were used was different.,S
347,on noisy speech when the system is trained on clean speech.,S
349,and when we use the filter that's derived from clean speech we jumped.,S
354,yeah.,S
357,i don't i will not i think investigate on the other differences.,S
386,uhhuh.,S
388,so i mean i think we'd want to standardize there.,S
394,yeah.,B
400,right.,S
409,it's something that's also short enough in in latency.,S
413,yeah.,B
419,well uh that's something's,D
421,yeah.,F
422,then,D
424,i think as long as you guys agree on it it doesn't matter.,S
427,yeah.,B
442,uh that's that's the other thing.,S
448,always for the matched condition you always get a slightly better performance for log energy than c zero.,S
459,huh.,B
467,no i'm just you know being a manager this week.,S
509,oh so then you'll feed those,D
522,and uh another thing would be to extend this to uh digits or something where i can look at whole words.,S
533,great.,S
535,so that's that's it.,S
538,yeah.,B
548,and um the results were were better.,S
554,i'm going to be working on um implementing this mean subtraction approach in the far mike system.,S
557,one of the experiments we're going to do is um we're going to um train the a broadcast news net.,S
561,data that resembles read speech.,S
583,okay.,B
585,also i guess we had we've had these uh little discussions.,S
592,and not not uh doing the polar representation with magnitude and phase.,S
596,actually regarding the phase normalization,D
615,at least in principle it looks like there's there's uh a couple potential ways to do it.,S
618,and uh in rectangular kind of coordinates.,S
621,so you work with the complex numbers.,S
626,um,F
627,you know there might be some numerical issues.,S
631,uh actually i was talking to dick karp about it a little bit.,S
634,so one thing is that you'd have to do i think,D
636,we may have to do this on a whiteboard.,S
658,so there's,D
661,huh.,B
666,i i actually thought it was it was doing fine when i tested it once.,S
697,okay.,B
702,i was like i'm trying to find where the problem came.,S
714,uh yeah.,F
715,so i was actually that day i was thinking about doing something about the wiener filtering and then carlos matter of stuff.,S
722,so uh i'm actually uh thinking of using that also in this uh wiener filtering.,S
732,so i don't know.,F
733,i was,D
737,the the other thing was about the subspace approach.,S
739,i like plugged some groupings for computing this uh uh uh values and eigenvectors.,S
743,uh yeah.,F
744,i guess yep i guess that's it.,S
771,v t s.,S
775,remove some noise but not too much.,S
814,uhhuh.,B
823,so maybe if you tested it using that you'd have more reliable stretches of nonspeech to do the estimation from.,S
831,uhhuh.,B
834,the methods,D
855,the top equation is is is,D
878,so that's uh,D
897,yeah maybe,F
898,one one plus n by x.,S
900,well we can we can put this expression,D
912,i actually don't see how you get that.,S
915,huh.,B
920,and log of,D
923,uhhuh.,B
932,we have first that for example x is equal,D
934,well.,F
935,this is the frequency domain.,S
951,but this,D
954,maybe we can take it off line.,S
957,i i can do this incorrectly.,S
966,yeah.,S
969,yeah.,F
970,yeah because it doesn't just follow what's there.,S
985,that doesn't follow.,S
995,but we can,D
1037,so let's,D
1041,and then,D
1062,in this case well we can put here a y.,S
1064,so yeah.,F
1065,it's just by definition that the individual that the uh,D
1086,pfff!,S
1093,yeah right.,B
1101,we have fixed this,D
1132,how,D
1145,i the clean speech the codebook for clean speech i am using timit.,S
1171,well we we obtain the means for each gaussian and the variance.,S
1193,and i can calculate this.,S
1230,when i develop this in taylor taylor series i can't um calculate the mean and the variance of the for each of the gaussian of the dictionary for the noisy speech.,S
1239,i,D
1277,i mean i know you don't have a lot of data to estimate with.,S
1279,um,F
1280,i estimate mean and variance for each one of the gaussian of the codebook.,S
1290,right.,S
1325,also another question might be,D
1334,yeah.,S
1343,well i guess we're about done.,S
1345,so some of the digit forms don't have digits.,S
1350,i guess you've got some right morgan?,S
1356,uh okay.,S
1363,they prefer to have them on.,S
69,so what i was thinking is we could start just by filling it out and then reading reading the numbers on the form.,S
85,just so that,D
124,yeah i mean the equipment,D
126,the me and adam went through it yesterday just looked at everything.,S
157,yeah.,B
163,but well we should get to a a nice kind of working state of our set up as quickly as possible.,S
169,yeah.,B
171,i mean there's one big issue with the equipment still which is um ultimately we're going to well the idea is to have any number of these wired headsets.,S
211,okay.,B
230,okay.,B
243,but i think that if my point is i guess if you if you have a um a uh a volume in between the two the two uh uh sensors and you do something cleverer there clearly are ways to get more out of it.,S
275,hopefully.,S
300,yep yep.,S
318,and that that seems very uh easy to believe scenario i mean given the number of palm pilots we've got on the table right now so,D
331,well i know.,S
334,except i got a p d a way before,D
361,we have the um the ones we've been using the ones we got for the p c.,S
369,right right.,B
429,yeah.,B
471,yeah it's pretty horrible.,S
535,probably we could we could probably just run shorten on them or something and it will get a big win.,S
567,because uh we i mean we're not talking about forty or fifty hours at this point.,S
575,yeah i was interested when i saw the twenty four on there.,S
580,so,F
581,yeah that's right.,S
594,right.,B
627,one suggestion i have is that um i think this maybe we should just read some more you made more of these.,S
668,jerry also said it would be he would be willing to have his group some of the a i meetings do it as well.,S
671,exactly exactly.,S
711,maybe we should have the reading group here and force jane to come.,S
778,so that i mean that's one chunk of work and just segmenting for this is going to be another chunk of work.,S
780,yeah.,S
857,right.,B
2,you can fill those out uh after actually.,S
4,so i got uh these results from uh stephane.,S
26,uh go ahead.,S
47,so uh,F
48,yeah.,F
49,until saturday midnight or something we have,D
52,well that would be good.,S
61,yeah.,B
63,so um,F
64,so we'll we'll hold off on that a little bit.,S
67,and it looks like the overall result as they are now even without you know any any bugs being fixed is that uh on the the other tasks we had this average of uh uh nine percent or so improvement.,S
72,so that's good.,S
75,and trying to see if what should ultimately be proposed is some uh combination of things.,S
77,because there's things that they are doing there that we certainly are not doing.,S
83,so,F
118,so um my impression is they also did very well on on the the uh evaluation set.,S
128,actually something that's close to cepstral mean subtraction.,S
145,uh it's possible that some combination of these different things that were done would be the best thing to do.,S
164,so uh in practice,D
169,oh.,S
172,um so that's a nice feature of what what we did.,S
174,but um well we still have to see how it all comes out.,S
189,they uh,D
191,and the the uh results are due like the day before the meeting or something.,S
193,yeah.,S
199,so um since we have a bit farther to travel than some of the others uh we'll have to get done a little quicker.,D
208,uh i think you know the main reason for having,D
212,yeah.,S
217,huh.,F
218,so we're going to end up with these same kind of sheets that have the the percentages and so on just for the,D
229,well that'll be good.,S
237,i mean i think the question is is there is there some advantage.,S
244,um uh that's one one aspect of it.,S
254,so it seems like the main different there is the is the uh filtering.,S
277,and people often work on new standards while an old standard is in place and so on.,S
281,you you you will you will become experts on this and know more far more than me about the this particular standards process once you you go to this meeting.,S
283,be interested in hearing.,S
294,huh,F
295,well first uh to really have a look at at the speech from these databases.,S
300,it's a novel idea.,S
314,yeah so perhaps we could have a a large gain uh just by looking at improving the uh recognition not of phonemes but of phoneme classes simply.,S
353,what about,D
356,so there is this the mismatched is um the same kind of thing.,S
363,uh okay.,S
365,so so,F
366,i see.,S
368,so the high so the right so the highly mismatched case is in some sense a good model for what we've been you know typically talking about when we talk about additive noise in,D
374,actually yeah it's very close to clean speech training because well because the close microphone and noisy speech testing.,S
386,yeah.,B
395,it doesn't work.,S
402,so uh we still have stuff to do.,S
405,i don't know.,S
425,and uh one of the things i don't remember the details on but i remember at some point when you were working with a second stream and you tried a low pass filtering to cepstrum in some case you got,D
440,uh and you had you know you had the multi band things also and you know there was issue of that.,S
448,so i think that you know this is a uh this is a neat data set.,S
452,and uh,F
453,what i like about it in a way is that uh the results are still so terrible.,S
459,i think that's great that because and also because again it's not something,D
467,but it was all pretty artificial.,S
470,uh this is what's nice about the aurora data and the data here is that is that it's sort of a realistic room situation uh acoustics acoustic situation both terms in noise and reflections and so on.,S
472,uh with something that's still relatively realistic it's still very very hard to do very well.,S
474,yeah.,B
476,so,D
478,actually this is that's why we,D
485,yeah.,F
486,so this would be the first thing.,S
492,yeah.,B
494,no i i think there's lots of lots of good things to do with this.,S
496,um,F
497,so let's,D
515,uhhuh.,B
519,uh so yeah.,F
520,i don't know if we can get some hand labeled data from other languages.,S
536,that was a question that was kind of raised by mike shire's thesis and on in that case in terms of reverberation.,S
541,right.,F
542,so next week we uh won't meet because you'll be in europe.,S
569,yeah.,F
570,well if we don't have anything else to discuss we should uh turn off the machine and then say the real nasty things.,S
16,well we'll drag him here.,S
26,i have something just fairly brief to report on.,S
32,so what i was started playing with was the again this is the h t k back end.,S
34,i was curious because the way that they train up the models they go through about four sort of rounds of of training.,S
38,you know that's part of what takes so long to train the the the back end for this.,S
43,i i'm sorry.,S
46,maybe i should write it on the board.,S
49,i i i guess you could say iterations.,S
70,uh one two.,S
74,um i i ran a couple of experiments where i reduced that to to be three two two uh five i think.,S
79,i i think it only took something like uh three or four hours to do the full training.,S
88,uh,F
89,even we don't do anything else doing something like this could allow us to turn experiments around a lot faster.,S
94,and it's a real simple change to make.,S
116,uhhuh.,B
124,oh the other thing that i did was um i compiled the h t k stuff for the linux boxes.,S
135,i've forgotten now what the name of that machine is.,S
142,and you may not have had that in your dot c s h r c before if you were always just running the sparc.,S
144,um,F
145,uh i can i can tell you exactly what you need to do to get all of that to work.,S
152,huh.,B
157,yeah in fact you could do something like keep exactly the same procedure and then add a fifth thing onto it.,S
162,right.,S
168,let's see.,S
170,it goes from,D
178,and i think what happens here is,D
182,uh,F
183,yeah it's uh,D
189,there because they start off with uh an initial model.,S
201,yeah.,F
202,there was a conference call this tuesday.,S
204,i don't know yet the what happened tuesday.,S
207,oh this is a conference call for uh uh aurora participant sort of thing.,S
222,all right.,S
224,yeah.,F
225,so the points were the the weights how to weight the different error rates that are obtained from different language and and conditions.,S
227,it's not clear that they will keep the same kind of weighting.,S
232,well to to combine error rates before computing improvement.,S
239,yeah.,S
241,yeah.,S
257,i haven't thought it through.,S
267,well it seems like they should do like the percentage improvement or something.,S
280,yeah.,F
281,and so when you average the the relative improvement it tends to to give a lot of of um importance to the well matched case.,S
284,um,F
303,so they said how much is significantly better.,S
312,huh.,B
322,but there is this this is this still this problem of weights.,S
330,it sounds like they don't really have a good idea about what the final application is going to be.,S
342,um,F
343,i think the hope would be that it would uh it would work well for the good cases.,S
346,yeah.,B
361,you assume everything's equal.,S
374,so not try to combine them.,S
376,yeah.,S
386,i guess what you would do in practice is you'd try to get as many uh examples of similar sort of stuff as you could.,S
390,so the argument for that being the the the more important thing is that you're going to try and do that but you want to see how badly it deviates from that when when when the uh it's a little different.,S
392,um,F
393,so you should weight those other conditions very you know really small.,S
395,no.,S
412,uhhuh.,B
418,i think the thing is is that if you look at the well matched case versus the you know the the medium and the and the and then the mismatched case um we're seeing really really big differences in performance.,S
431,um,F
432,yeah i mean the reference one for instance this is back old on uh on italian uh was like six percent error for the well matched.,S
436,and you know with these other systems we we helped it out quite a bit.,S
455,right.,S
458,same microphone.,S
474,so since they have these three categories it seems like the reasonable thing to do is to go across the languages and to come up with an improvement for each of those.,S
481,you should see uh a gentle degradation through that.,S
484,but,F
485,i don't know.,F
486,yeah.,B
492,uhhuh.,B
494,yeah.,B
496,uh so,F
497,yeah.,F
498,yeah.,S
514,good.,S
516,work to do.,S
523,huh,F
524,so i don't know.,S
526,but,F
527,yeah.,F
528,oh.,B
535,yeah.,B
541,yeah.,F
542,uh yeah.,F
543,someone told that perhaps it's not fair to do that because the um to make a good v a d you don't have enough to with the the features that are the baseline features.,S
545,huh,F
546,you need more features.,S
551,sure.,S
558,so so you,D
573,that's not clear.,S
584,i don't,D
611,and if one of the ways you make it better is by having your features be better features for the v a d then that's so be it.,S
616,because some of the some of the people didn't have a v a d at all i guess.,S
619,yeah.,S
624,uhhuh.,B
627,and if it turns out that you can't improve on that well i mean then you know nobody wins and you just use m f c c.,S
632,it should include sort of the current state of the art that you want are trying to improve.,S
638,um,F
639,it seems like whatever they choose they shouldn't you know purposefully brain damage a part of the system to make a worse baseline.,S
654,uh,F
655,yeah.,F
656,so,F
657,we'll see what happen with this.,S
659,yeah.,S
671,i have no idea.,S
677,i asked sunil for more information about that.,S
679,i don't know yet.,S
681,and what's happened here is that we,D
707,okay.,S
709,uhhuh.,B
715,uh putting neural network compared to not having any neural network.,S
725,yeah i don't know i i uh uh,D
732,yeah.,S
742,um,F
743,with the short filter it's not worse.,S
751,so let me try to understand.,S
766,so yeah.,F
767,uh,F
768,yeah but it's a good thing anyway to have shorter delay.,S
777,and it doesn't seem to help.,S
781,uh,F
782,we have to wait for that to fill the whole table.,S
784,okay.,S
792,oh well i have the picture.,S
804,wait a minute.,S
812,yeah,D
818,uhhuh.,B
830,yeah.,F
831,we have here some histogram.,S
836,so,F
837,well.,F
838,for unvoiced portion we have something that has a mean around o point three.,S
850,for,D
852,but if we look at it in one sentence it apparently it's good.,S
862,it seems quite robust to noise.,S
875,uh,F
876,yeah hopefully i think what we want to have is to put these features in some kind of,D
878,well to to obtain a statistical model on these features.,S
889,well i i don't know that i would trust that so much.,S
895,really that's sort of a cartoon picture about what's voiced and unvoiced.,S
898,yeah.,B
921,right.,S
926,the the more obvious is that that,D
929,yeah.,S
936,uhhuh.,B
956,and what is it about the excitation.,S
959,so i i would almost take a,D
968,yeah.,F
979,yeah it could be uh it could be a neural network that does voiced and unvoiced detection.,S
984,but each one of the mixture components,D
986,i mean you have uh uh variance only.,S
990,uh,F
991,i think it's a neat thing.,S
996,yeah.,F
997,i mean i know that um people doing some robustness things a ways back were were just doing just being gross and just throwing in the f f t.,S
1005,so,F
1006,so how does,D
1058,two thousand and fifteen hundred.,S
1062,yeah.,S
1072,uhhuh.,S
1079,yeah.,B
1086,okay.,S
1092,yeah.,S
1094,um,F
1095,and that's,D
1099,yeah.,S
1140,yeah.,B
1143,this is the between,D
1147,but it's this.,S
1164,huh.,B
1170,does does the periodicity of this signal say something about the the,D
1241,it's the excitation.,S
1253,but whenever you smooth you lose something.,S
1270,and and and also in time.,S
1272,that's that's really neat.,S
1283,yeah well.,S
1290,yeah.,B
1301,oops.,S
1328,this is kind of interesting also.,S
1338,oh it's that time frequency trade off thing.,S
1344,uhhuh.,B
1356,so with a short frame basically you have only two periods.,S
1366,so probably we'll have to use like long long frames.,S
1368,uhhuh.,S
1383,huh.,B
1389,i guess it depends.,S
1394,i guess ericsson is on the um filter bank.,S
1400,so yeah.,F
1401,probably,D
1414,huh.,B
1417,that's all.,S
1420,yeah.,F
1421,okay.,S
1424,or,D
1428,okay.,B
1434,it's um in june.,S
1445,and he's been doing all the talking.,S
1451,make make sure carmen talks as well.,S
1454,oh i i am doing this.,S
1476,anything to,D
1482,but uh um i decided not to do that after all.,S
1501,certainly in a short short term this just sounds easier.,S
1504,i mean longer term if it's if it turns out to be useful one one might want to do something else.,S
1507,uh uh i mean in in other words you you may be putting other kinds of errors in from the re synthesis process.,S
1509,from the re synthesis.,S
1511,yeah.,B
1518,don't know.,S
1532,well i've been continuing reading.,S
1535,looking at uh uh modulation spectrum stuff.,S
1537,and and learning a bit about what what um what it is.,S
1546,sure.,S
1555,it's not i mean they're sort of not in the same kind of category as say a phonetic target or a syllabic target.,S
1569,yeah.,B
1575,yeah.,B
